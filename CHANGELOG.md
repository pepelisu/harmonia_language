## v2.0 — The Polyphonic Layer

**The shift:** In v1.0 and v1.1, a chord was read as 
ROOT + QUALITY — one noun plus one adjective. The other notes 
inside the chord were treated as structural (defining major 
vs. minor) but not as independently meaningful.

In v2.0, every note inside a chord carries its own semantic 
domain. A chord is no longer one word modified. It is 
**multiple meanings sounding simultaneously.**

This was the original idea behind Harmonia — translating 
*chords* (combinations of notes), not just notes with 
modifiers. v2.0 returns to that original vision.

### What Changed

- **New chapter:** [Chapter 12 — The Polyphonic Layer](book/12-polyphonic-layer.md)
- **New reference:** [Polyphonic Dictionary](reference/polyphonic-dictionary.md) — 
  every triad and 7th chord read through all constituent notes
- **New reference:** [Differential Table](reference/differential-table.md) — 
  what specific note changes between major and minor, and what that 
  transformation means
- **Updated:** [Quick Reference](reference/quick-reference.md) — 
  now includes both Layer 1 (basic) and Layer 2 (polyphonic)

### What Didn't Change

- The v1.1 system (root + quality + connective tissue) remains 
  fully intact as **Layer 1**
- All six translations and the original composition remain valid
- The MIDI scripts are unchanged
- The honest assessment still applies — and applies equally to 
  the polyphonic layer (the root assignments are still creative 
  choices, not discoveries)

### How the Two Layers Work Together

| | Layer 1 (v1.1) | Layer 2 (v2.0) |
|---|---|---|
| **Reads** | Root + quality | All constituent notes |
| **A chord is** | One concept, modified | Multiple concepts, simultaneous |
| **Major/minor is** | Positive/negative | A specific internal transformation |
| **Best for** | Quick reading, first pass | Deep analysis, structural insight |
| **Difficulty** | Accessible | Requires holding multiple meanings at once |
| **Use when** | Translating rapidly, teaching, composing | Analyzing why a piece works, literary reading |

Both layers use the same 12-root dictionary. They are not 
contradictory — Layer 2 contains Layer 1 and adds depth.

## v1.1 — Connective Tissue

Added walking bass, melodic bridges, inner voice continuity, 
pickup notes, and appoggiaturas. Chords became speech instead 
of telegrams.

## v1.0 — Initial Release

12 roots, chord qualities as modifiers, basic grammar 
(octave=tense, inversion=case, dynamics=register), six 
translations, one original composition, complete grammar, 
honest assessment.
