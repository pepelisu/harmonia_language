# I. MAJOR TRIADS

*Structure: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], affirmed*
*Layer 2 reading: three simultaneous domains*

---

## C Major
**Notes:** C + E + G
**Domains:** Self + Emotion + Connection

> **"A being that feels and connects."**

The most fundamental chord in Western music contains the three 
fundamental elements of human experience: existing, feeling, 
and belonging. This may be why it sounds "neutral" or 
"complete" — it describes the baseline human condition.

---

## Db Major
**Notes:** Db + F + Ab
**Domains:** Boundary + Nature + Spirit

> **"A threshold between the physical and the sacred."**

The border where the material world meets the transcendent. 
A church doorway. A mountain peak. The surface of water. Any 
place where the physical world touches something beyond itself.

---

## D Major
**Notes:** D + F# + A
**Domains:** Action + Unknown + Knowledge

> **"Doing that reaches into mystery toward understanding."**

The chord of the quest. You act, you enter unknown territory, 
you gain knowledge. Every adventure, every experiment, every 
question answered through pursuit.

---

## Eb Major
**Notes:** Eb + G + Bb
**Domains:** Home + Connection + Desire

> **"A place of belonging, shared, and longed for."**

Home as community. Not just a building but a place where 
people are together and where you want to be. The family 
table. The hometown. The gathering place.

---

## E Major
**Notes:** E + G# + B
**Domains:** Emotion + Spirit + Time

> **"Feeling that transcends the moment."**

Emotion elevated beyond the personal and temporal. Joy that 
touches the sacred. Grief that reaches beyond the self. The 
kind of feeling that makes you believe in something larger — 
religious ecstasy, artistic rapture, the sublime.

---

## F Major
**Notes:** F + A + C
**Domains:** Nature + Knowledge + Self

> **"The physical world, understood, inhabited by the self."**

Complete engagement with material reality. The world known 
and lived in. Cervantes' key: the earth underfoot, the food 
on the table, the body in the room. Not mystified, not 
questioned — simply inhabited and understood.

---

## F# Major
**Notes:** F# + A# + C#
**Domains:** Unknown + Desire + Boundary

> **"Mystery longed for at the edge of the known."**

The farthest key from C on the circle of fifths — the most 
remote conceptual territory. What lies beyond every map. The 
desire to cross the last frontier. Curiosity at its most 
extreme.

---

## G Major
**Notes:** G + B + D
**Domains:** Connection + Time + Action

> **"Togetherness across time, expressed through doing."**

Connection that endures and acts. Not passive belonging but 
active, temporal relationship — working together, growing 
together, building something across years. Marriage. 
Partnership. Community sustained through effort.

Donne's key: connection affirmed, enacted, persisting through 
time.

---

## Ab Major
**Notes:** Ab + C + Eb
**Domains:** Spirit + Self + Home

> **"The sacred made personal, made into a dwelling place."**

The transcendent is not distant or abstract — it is where 
the self lives. God in the home. The numinous in the everyday. 
A spirituality that is intimate and domestic rather than 
institutional.

---

## A Major
**Notes:** A + C# + E
**Domains:** Knowledge + Boundary + Emotion

> **"Understanding won through confrontation, felt deeply."**

Knowledge that has been tested against limits. Understanding 
earned by pushing against walls — external resistance that 
yielded to persistence. This is not gentle wisdom. This is 
battle-won truth. Etta James' key: she knows because she hit 
the wall.

---

## Bb Major
**Notes:** Bb + D + F
**Domains:** Desire + Action + Nature

> **"Wanting that moves through the physical world."**

Desire embodied in action and grounded in reality. Not 
abstract longing but wanting-that-does. The hunger that 
drives you to hunt, to build, to reach. Aspiration with 
dirt under its fingernails.

---

## B Major
**Notes:** B + D# + F#
**Domains:** Time + Home + Unknown

> **"A moment of belonging at the edge of the unknowable."**

The threshold moment — time, place, and mystery converging. 
The instant before departure. The last night before everything 
changes. The border of the familiar touching the border of the 
unimaginable.

---

# II. MINOR TRIADS

*Structure: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], absent/reflected*
*Layer 2 reading: three simultaneous domains, with one 
domain transformed from the major version*

---

## C Minor
**Notes:** C + Eb + G
**Domains:** Self + Home + Connection
**Differential:** E→Eb = Emotion → Home

> **"A being that belongs and connects — but feeling has been 
replaced by place."**

The self still has belonging and connection. But the active 
feeling (E) that animated C major has transformed into passive 
belonging (Eb). The heart became a hearth. Emotion became 
shelter. What was felt is now merely inhabited.

In Donne: the false premise of isolation — a self with 
belonging and connection, but lacking feeling.
In Cervantes: the self consumed by the material — belonging 
to a place and to people, but not feeling.

---

## C#/Db Minor
**Notes:** Db + E + Ab
**Domains:** Boundary + Emotion + Spirit
**Differential:** F→E = Nature → Emotion

> **"A threshold made of feeling and the sacred."**

The physical (F) has transformed into the felt (E). The 
boundary is no longer a material wall — it is emotional and 
spiritual. You don't walk through this threshold. You feel 
your way through it.

---

## D Minor
**Notes:** D + F + A
**Domains:** Action + Nature + Knowledge
**Differential:** F#→F = Unknown → Nature

> **"Doing grounded in the physical world, yielding 
understanding."**

The mystery (F#) of D major has transformed into the physical 
(F). The quest is over. The adventure has become work. What 
was unknown exploration is now practical, embodied, earthly 
labor. But it still yields knowledge — just the kind earned 
through hands, not through daring.

In Beethoven's storm section: "I was still" — action that has 
ceased to reach toward the unknown and has settled into the 
physical.

---

## Eb Minor
**Notes:** Eb + Gb + Bb
**Domains:** Home + Unknown + Desire
**Differential:** G→Gb = Connection → Unknown

> **"A place of belonging lost to mystery, only longed for."**

The community (G) that made Eb major a warm place has 
dissolved into the unknown (Gb). Home without people. A 
place you belong to but that has become strange. The family 
scattered. The hometown unrecognizable. Exile — not from a 
location, but from the community that made it home.

---

## E Minor
**Notes:** E + G + B
**Domains:** Emotion + Connection + Time
**Differential:** G#→G = Spirit → Connection

> **"Feeling through relationship across time."**

The spiritual transcendence (G#) of E major has become human 
connection (G). What could have been religious ecstasy became 
friendship. What could have been abstract sublimity became a 
boy finding his people.

Hedwig's key: the story is not about transcending the world. 
It is about finding your place in it, with others, across 
the years of growing up. The sacred became the social. Spirit 
became togetherness. And somehow that is more moving, not 
less.

---

## F Minor
**Notes:** F + Ab + C
**Domains:** Nature + Spirit + Self
**Differential:** A→Ab = Knowledge → Spirit

> **"The physical world touched by the sacred, containing 
a self."**

What was understood (A) in F major has become mysterious (Ab). 
The world is no longer known. It is haunted, enchanted, 
numinous. The same physical reality — the same earth, the 
same body — but now infused with something the mind cannot 
grasp. Illness as spiritual trial. Winter as sacred passage. 
The body as temple.

In Donne: "the earth erodes" — not merely physical erosion 
but the dissolution of the known into the ineffable.

---

## F# Minor
**Notes:** F# + A + C#
**Domains:** Unknown + Knowledge + Boundary
**Differential:** A#→A = Desire → Knowledge

> **"Mystery that is partially understood, at a threshold."**

The longing (A#) that drives F# major's quest for the unknown 
has transformed into understanding (A). You no longer desire 
the mystery — you partially comprehend it. You stand at the 
boundary of what can be known, having traded your wanting for 
whatever wisdom you gained.

In "Knowing": the felt gap — the awareness that something is 
out there that you cannot name, but which you have begun to 
understand.

---

## G Minor
**Notes:** G + Bb + D
**Domains:** Connection + Desire + Action
**Differential:** B→Bb = Time → Desire

> **"Togetherness that is wanted and pursued."**

The time (B) that sustained G major's connection has 
transformed into desire (Bb). The relationship is no longer 
lived across time. It is longed for. What was experienced 
became what is wanted. The shared past became a wish for return.

Autumn Leaves' key: connection is not experienced — it is 
desired. Not remembered in time — remembered as want. The 
person is gone. What remains is not the relationship itself 
but the ache for it.

---

## Ab/G# Minor
**Notes:** Ab + B + Eb
**Domains:** Spirit + Time + Home
**Differential:** C→B = Self → Time

> **"The sacred, held in time, sheltering."**

The self (C) has dissolved into time (B). The individual is 
no longer central — impermanence is. The sacred persists, 
and it shelters, but the person within it has become 
temporary. A cathedral that will outlast every worshipper. 
A tradition that carries no single name.

---

## A Minor
**Notes:** A + C + E
**Domains:** Knowledge + Self + Emotion
**Differential:** C#→C = Boundary → Self

> **"Understanding through personal experience and feeling."**

The external boundary (C#) of A major has collapsed inward 
into the self (C). Knowledge is no longer won through 
confrontation with the world. It is gained through 
introspection, through felt experience, through being.

Beethoven's key: he doesn't understand not because the world 
resists him but because his own self is the mystery. The wall 
he can't get through is himself.

The "Knowing" composition: Am as "knowing what is missing" — 
understanding that comes from personal, intimate, felt 
experience of absence.

---

## Bb Minor
**Notes:** Bb + Db + F
**Domains:** Desire + Boundary + Nature
**Differential:** D→Db = Action → Boundary

> **"Wanting that meets a wall in the physical world."**

The action (D) that animated Bb major's desire has become a 
boundary (Db). The pursuit has stopped. The wanting still 
exists, and the physical world is still there, but movement 
has been blocked. Frustrated desire. The dream that cannot 
be realized. The door that won't open.

In Cervantes: "de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme" — desire 
(not wanting to remember) meeting a boundary (the refusal). 
The narrator's desire-toward-a-boundary.

---

## B Minor
**Notes:** B + D + F#
**Domains:** Time + Action + Unknown
**Differential:** D#→D = Home → Action

> **"Time set in motion, heading into the unknowable."**

The belonging (D#) that grounded B major has transformed into 
movement (D). The settled has become the restless. Time no 
longer holds a place — it propels into the unknown.

In Etta James: "it is ending" — time in motion, carrying 
things away. In Hedwig: the final chord of the opening 
passage — the adventure begins. In Autumn Leaves: "what 
was lost in time" — time that has moved, carrying the known 
into the unknown.

---

# III. DOMINANT 7TH CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], questioning/seeking*
*Layer 2 reading: four simultaneous domains, with the b7 
adding tension and the need for resolution*

*The dominant 7th is inherently unstable. In Layer 2, the 
fourth note (the b7) is always one whole step below the root, 
which means it is always the domain TWO steps counterclockwise 
on the circle of fifths. This creates a built-in pull between 
the root domain and a related-but-different domain.*

---

## C7
**Notes:** C + E + G + Bb
**Domains:** Self + Emotion + Connection + Desire

> **"A being that feels, connects, and wants."**

The self animated by three forces: feeling, belonging, and 
longing. Existence driven by need. Everything in C major, 
plus hunger. The b7 (Bb = Desire) adds: "And I want. And 
that wanting destabilizes everything."

---

## Db7
**Notes:** Db + F + Ab + B
**Domains:** Boundary + Nature + Spirit + Time

> **"A threshold between the physical and the sacred, 
marked by time."**

The boundary-world-spirit triad of Db major, now with Time 
added. The threshold is temporal — it exists at a specific 
moment. A door that opens only once. A window that is closing.

---

## D7
**Notes:** D + F# + A + C
**Domains:** Action + Unknown + Knowledge + Self

> **"Doing that reaches into mystery toward understanding 
of the self."**

D major's quest, now with a destination: the self. The 
unknown is explored, knowledge is gained, and what is 
ultimately found is who you are. The hero's journey in four 
notes — you leave (D), enter the unknown (F#), learn 
something (A), and discover yourself (C).

In Autumn Leaves: "Where am I going?" — but now we can read 
the answer embedded in the chord itself. The b7 (C = Self) 
says: toward yourself. You are falling toward your own being.

---

## Eb7
**Notes:** Eb + G + Bb + Db
**Domains:** Home + Connection + Desire + Boundary

> **"Belonging shared and longed for, at a limit."**

Home-community-wanting, now encountering a boundary. The 
question: can this belonging persist? Will it hit a wall? 
The dominant 7th's instability says: this home is under 
pressure. Something must give.

---

## E7
**Notes:** E + G# + B + D
**Domains:** Emotion + Spirit + Time + Action

> **"Feeling that transcends the moment and demands a 
response."**

E major's spiritual emotion, now with Action (D) demanding 
expression. This feeling cannot remain internal. It must 
be enacted. Love that demands declaration. Grief that demands 
ritual. Joy that demands dance.

In Etta James: "Why do I still feel this?" — but the D 
(Action) inside the chord answers: because feeling demands 
doing. You can't just feel. You must respond. The question 
and its imperative coexist in the same chord.

---

## F7
**Notes:** F + A + C + Eb
**Domains:** Nature + Knowledge + Self + Home

> **"The physical world understood as the self's dwelling."**

F major's known, inhabited world, now with Home (Eb) added. 
The world is not just understood — it is settled into. This 
is where you live. The b7 converts knowledge of the world 
into belonging to it.

In Autumn Leaves: "What has become of this world we touched?" 
— the world known, selfed, homed — but the dominant 7th's 
instability says all of this is about to change.

---

## F#7
**Notes:** F# + A# + C# + E
**Domains:** Unknown + Desire + Boundary + Emotion

> **"Mystery longed for at the edge, felt deeply."**

The most remote quest, now with Emotion (E) making it 
personal. This is not abstract curiosity. This is felt 
yearning toward the furthest unknown, pressing against the 
final boundary.

---

## G7
**Notes:** G + B + D + F
**Domains:** Connection + Time + Action + Nature

> **"Togetherness across time, enacted in the physical 
world."**

The fullest description of community-in-action: people 
together, over time, doing things, in the physical world. 
Building. Farming. Making. Living together. The b7 (F = 
Nature) grounds the connection in material reality.

---

## Ab7
**Notes:** Ab + C + Eb + Gb
**Domains:** Spirit + Self + Home + Unknown

> **"The sacred made personal, sheltering, at the edge of 
mystery."**

The spiritual-domestic world of Ab major, now touching the 
Unknown (Gb). The sacred home encounters what it cannot 
contain. The faith that meets its doubt. The sanctuary that 
discovers its boundary.

---

## A7
**Notes:** A + C# + E + G
**Domains:** Knowledge + Boundary + Emotion + Connection

> **"Understanding through confrontation, felt and shared."**

A major's battle-won knowledge, now with Connection (G) 
added. This is knowledge that has been fought for AND shared. 
Earned truth brought into community. The teacher returning 
from the mountain. The lesson learned the hard way, now 
offered to others.

"Do you understand what we've been through together?"

---

## Bb7
**Notes:** Bb + D + F + Ab
**Domains:** Desire + Action + Nature + Spirit

> **"Wanting that moves through the physical world toward 
the sacred."**

Bb major's embodied desire, now reaching toward Spirit (Ab). 
The physical hunger becomes spiritual aspiration. The body's 
wanting becomes the soul's yearning. Pilgrimage — desire 
that walks through the material world toward the transcendent.

---

## B7
**Notes:** B + D# + F# + A
**Domains:** Time + Home + Unknown + Knowledge

> **"A moment of belonging at the edge of mystery, partially 
understood."**

The threshold-moment of B major, now with Knowledge (A) 
adding partial comprehension. You stand at the border, you 
belong to this moment, you face the unknown — and you 
understand just enough to know what you're about to lose.

---

# IV. MAJOR 7TH CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th + Major 7th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], wondrous/beautiful*
*Layer 2 reading: four simultaneous domains, with the 
natural 7th adding luminosity and openness*

*The major 7th is one half step below the octave — almost 
home, not quite arrived. It creates a shimmering, open 
quality. In Layer 2, the major 7th is always the note 
one half step below the root, meaning it is the domain 
one position clockwise on the circle of fifths — the root's 
nearest neighbor in the "sharp" direction.*

---

## Cmaj7
**Notes:** C + E + G + B
**Domains:** Self + Emotion + Connection + Time

> **"A being that feels, connects, and exists in time."**

The complete human situation in four notes. Existence, 
interiority, community, mortality. Every element of 
conscious life is present. Nothing missing. Nothing 
excessive.

This may be why the major 7th chord sounds so luminous and 
complete. It is semantically complete. It says: *"Life."*

In Hedwig's Theme: the moment the B (Time) enters the C 
chord. Being acquires temporality. Existence becomes a story. 
In Cervantes: the seed of Quixote — the self finding wonder 
in the ordinary (applied to wool, later to windmills).

---

## Dbmaj7
**Notes:** Db + F + Ab + C
**Domains:** Boundary + Nature + Spirit + Self

> **"A threshold between the physical and the sacred, 
containing a self."**

The Db major threshold, now with Self (C) inside it. You 
are not merely at the boundary — you ARE the boundary. The 
border between worlds runs through you.

---

## Dmaj7
**Notes:** D + F# + A + C#
**Domains:** Action + Unknown + Knowledge + Boundary

> **"The quest that encounters limits on the way to 
understanding."**

D major's adventure, now with Boundary (C#) added. The quest 
is not effortless. There are walls. There are limits. 
Knowledge is gained by pressing against them. The beautiful 
quest — arduous and wondrous.

---

## Ebmaj7
**Notes:** Eb + G + Bb + D
**Domains:** Home + Connection + Desire + Action

> **"Belonging, shared, longed for, and acted upon."**

The community that builds. Home as a verb, not just a place. 
Wanting to belong and doing something about it. The barn-
raising. The neighborhood watch. The family that works to 
stay together.

In Autumn Leaves: "How beautiful it was to belong" — the 
luminous peak of the bright world, the memory at its warmest.

---

## Emaj7
**Notes:** E + G# + B + D#
**Domains:** Emotion + Spirit + Time + Home

> **"Feeling that transcends time and finds a dwelling."**

The fullest emotional chord. Feeling that is spiritual, 
temporal, and belonging. Emotion that has found where it 
lives. Not restless passion but feeling that has settled 
into its home in the sacred and the eternal.

---

## Fmaj7
**Notes:** F + A + C + E
**Domains:** Nature + Knowledge + Self + Emotion

> **"The world understood, inhabited, and felt."**

F major's known world, now with Emotion (E). Not cold 
knowledge but felt understanding. The difference between 
studying a forest and walking through it with tears in your 
eyes. The physical world known AND loved.

In Donne: "the vast, beautiful world."
In Autumn Leaves: "how beautiful the world is."
In Cervantes: the single pigeon on Sunday — the one moment 
of beauty in the weekly cycle.

---

## F#maj7
**Notes:** F# + A# + C# + E#(F)
**Domains:** Unknown + Desire + Boundary + Nature

> **"Mystery longed for at the edge, grounded in the 
physical."**

The furthest quest, now touching Nature (F = E#). Even at 
the most remote frontier of knowledge, the body is present. 
The explorer at the edge of the map still has feet on the 
ground, still needs food and water, still feels the wind.

---

## Gmaj7
**Notes:** G + B + D + F#
**Domains:** Connection + Time + Action + Unknown

> **"Togetherness across time, through doing, reaching 
into mystery."**

G major's community-in-action, now with Unknown (F#) added. 
The community that faces the unknown together. The expedition. 
The crew. The family entering uncharted territory. "We don't 
know what's ahead, but we're going together."

---

## Abmaj7
**Notes:** Ab + C + Eb + G
**Domains:** Spirit + Self + Home + Connection

> **"The sacred made personal, sheltering, and shared."**

The most complete spiritual chord. Spirit is present (Ab), 
the self is present (C), home is present (Eb), and connection 
is present (G). The faith community. The religious family. 
The spiritual practice that is personal, domestic, and 
communal all at once.

---

## Amaj7
**Notes:** A + C# + E + G#
**Domains:** Knowledge + Boundary + Emotion + Spirit

> **"Understanding through confrontation, felt deeply, 
touching the transcendent."**

A major's battle-won knowledge, now reaching toward Spirit 
(G#). The hard truth that opens into awe. The scientist who 
discovers something that makes them pray. Knowledge that 
began in conflict and ended in wonder.

---

## Bbmaj7
**Notes:** Bb + D + F + A
**Domains:** Desire + Action + Nature + Knowledge

> **"Wanting that moves through the physical world toward 
understanding."**

The quest in its fullest form. Desire provides the motive. 
Action provides the method. Nature provides the terrain. 
Knowledge provides the destination. This chord IS the 
adventure story. Beginning, middle, journey, and arrival 
in four notes.

In Autumn Leaves: "How beautiful it was to want" — the 
luminous memory of desire itself as a form of beauty.

---

## Bmaj7
**Notes:** B + D# + F# + A#
**Domains:** Time + Home + Unknown + Desire

> **"A moment of belonging at the edge of mystery, driven 
by longing."**

The threshold of B major, now with Desire (A#). Standing at 
the border of the known, belonging to this last moment of 
the familiar, longing for what lies beyond. The night before 
the expedition. The breath before the leap.

---

# V. MINOR 7TH CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], lingering in absence*
*Layer 2 reading: four simultaneous domains, combining 
the minor triad's transformation with the b7's pull*

---

## Cm7
**Notes:** C + Eb + G + Bb
**Domains:** Self + Home + Connection + Desire

> **"A self that belongs, connects, and longs."**

The exile's chord. Every element of social existence is 
present — place, people, wanting — but the Self has lost its 
Emotion (E→Eb). The being dwells, belongs, is surrounded — 
but does not feel. Or: the being that has replaced feeling 
with the comfort of place. Belonging as anesthesia.

In Autumn Leaves: "I was" — the melancholy existence of 
someone who has dwelling, community, and desire, but whose 
feeling has turned into mere habitation.

---

## C#m7 / Dbm7
**Notes:** C# + E + G# + B
**Domains:** Boundary + Emotion + Spirit + Time

> **"A threshold of feeling and the sacred, marked by time."**

The boundary-made-of-feeling from C#m, now with Time (B). 
This emotional threshold won't last. The door made of love 
has a clock on it. Cross now or lose the chance.

---

## Dm7
**Notes:** D + F + A + C
**Domains:** Action + Nature + Knowledge + Self

> **"Doing grounded in the physical world, yielding 
self-knowledge."**

The worker's chord. Labor, craft, practice. Action in the 
physical world that teaches you about yourself. The potter 
at the wheel. The farmer in the field. The musician in 
practice. You learn who you are through what you do with 
your hands.

In Autumn Leaves (ii chord): the beginning of the descent — 
but now we can read what that beginning contains. It is the 
self, grounded in work and the world, on the verge of 
falling.

---

## Ebm7
**Notes:** Eb + Gb + Bb + Db
**Domains:** Home + Unknown + Desire + Boundary

> **"A place of belonging dissolved into mystery, wanted, 
at a border."**

Exile deepened. Home is present (Eb) but the community has 
become unknown (Gb), the desire remains (Bb), and a wall 
stands (Db). You know where you belong, you can't get there, 
you don't recognize it anymore, and you want it desperately.

---

## Em7
**Notes:** E + G + B + D
**Domains:** Emotion + Connection + Time + Action

> **"Feeling through relationship across time, expressed 
in doing."**

Love as a verb. Not abstract emotion but feeling that 
exists in relationships, persists through time, and is 
expressed through action. This is what "I love you" means 
when it means something: I feel (E), with you (G), over 
time (B), through what I do (D).

---

## Fm7
**Notes:** F + Ab + C + Eb
**Domains:** Nature + Spirit + Self + Home

> **"The physical world touched by the sacred, sheltering 
a self."**

A body inside a spiritual home inside the natural world. 
Incarnation — spirit made flesh, given shelter, placed in 
the world. Or: the experience of being a body in a sacred 
place in nature. The hermitage. The retreat. The temple in 
the forest.

---

## F#m7
**Notes:** F# + A + C# + E
**Domains:** Unknown + Knowledge + Boundary + Emotion

> **"Mystery partially understood at a threshold, felt 
deeply."**

The scholar at the frontier. The researcher who has mapped 
part of the unknown, reached the edge of what can be known, 
and feels — with full emotional weight — both what has been 
understood and what remains beyond reach.

---

## Gm7
**Notes:** G + Bb + D + F
**Domains:** Connection + Desire + Action + Nature

> **"Togetherness wanted, pursued through the physical 
world."**

The search for community. Connection is present as a concept 
(G) and as a desire (Bb), and the searcher is moving (D) 
through the physical world (F) looking for it. The immigrant. 
The traveler seeking home among people.

---

## Abm7 / G#m7
**Notes:** Ab + B + Eb + Gb
**Domains:** Spirit + Time + Home + Unknown

> **"The sacred, held in time, sheltering, at the edge 
of mystery."**

A spiritual home that exists in a specific time and faces 
the unknown. A faith that is temporal, domestic, and 
conscious of what it doesn't know. Mature religion — sacred 
but humble, sheltering but open, anchored but aware of its 
own limits.

---

## Am7
**Notes:** A + C + E + G
**Domains:** Knowledge + Self + Emotion + Connection

> **"Understanding through personal experience, feeling, 
and relationship."**

**Wisdom.** The fullest form of human understanding: knowing 
that comes from who you are (C), what you feel (E), and who 
you know (G). Not academic knowledge. Not confrontational 
knowledge. Knowledge that is personal, emotional, and social 
all at once.

In Autumn Leaves: the half-diminished version (Am7b5) 
replaces E with Eb — Emotion becomes Home — and the wisdom 
begins to crumble. What was felt becomes merely inhabited. 
Active understanding becomes passive dwelling in memory.

## Bbm7
**Notes:** Bb + Db + F + Ab
**Domains:** Desire + Boundary + Nature + Spirit

> **"Wanting that meets a wall in the physical world, 
reaching toward the sacred."**

Frustrated desire that turns spiritual. When you can't get 
what you want in the material world, the longing reaches 
beyond it. The origin of prayer — desire blocked by reality, 
redirected toward the transcendent.

---

## Bm7
**Notes:** B + D + F# + A
**Domains:** Time + Action + Unknown + Knowledge

> **"Time in motion toward the unknown, gaining 
understanding."**

The journey through time — acting, encountering mystery, 
learning. A life in progress. Biography as a chord. The 
process of aging as the process of learning: time moves, 
you act, you face what you don't know, you understand a 
little more.

# VI. HALF-DIMINISHED CHORDS (m7♭5)

*Structure: Root + Minor 3rd + Diminished 5th + Minor 7th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], dissolving/crumbling*
*Layer 2 reading: four domains, with the b5 destabilizing 
the most structurally important interval — the foundation 
shifts*

*The b5 is crucial: the perfect 5th is the most stable 
interval in music. When it is flattened, the structural 
foundation cracks. In Layer 2, the 5th descends by one 
half step, transforming one domain into its neighbor — 
the same kind of transformation as major-to-minor, but 
applied to the foundation rather than the color.*

---

## Cm7♭5
**Notes:** C + Eb + Gb + Bb
**Domains:** Self + Home + Unknown + Desire

> **"A self sheltering in the unknown, wanting."**

C minor's Self+Home+Connection, but Connection (G) has 
crumbled into Unknown (Gb). The community has dissolved 
into mystery. You still have a self, you still have a 
sense of home, you still want — but the people are gone, 
replaced by uncertainty.

5th differential: G→Gb = Connection→Unknown. The foundation 
of togetherness has become a foundation of mystery.

---

## C#m7♭5
**Notes:** C# + E + G + B
**Domains:** Boundary + Emotion + Connection + Time

> **"A threshold of feeling and togetherness, in time."**

The boundary is emotional, social, and temporal. A moment 
shared between people at a crossing point. But the 
foundation (the 5th, normally G#=Spirit) has crumbled to 
G (Connection) — the spiritual ground beneath the threshold 
has been replaced by human relationship. The threshold holds 
because of people, not because of God.

---

## Dm7♭5
**Notes:** D + F + Ab + C
**Domains:** Action + Nature + Spirit + Self

> **"Doing in the physical world touching the sacred, 
revealing the self."**

D minor's grounded labor, but the structural foundation 
(A=Knowledge) has crumbled to Ab (Spirit). The ground of 
understanding gives way to the ground of mystery. You are 
still working, still in the world, still yourself — but 
what you thought you knew has become unknowable. Working 
in darkness. Building on faith instead of knowledge.

---

## Em7♭5
**Notes:** E + G + Bb + D
**Domains:** Emotion + Connection + Desire + Action

> **"Feeling through relationship, driven by wanting, 
expressed in doing."**

E minor's feeling-connection-time, but Time (B) has crumbled 
to Desire (Bb). The temporal foundation has become a 
foundation of longing. The relationship no longer endures 
through time — it persists through wanting. You don't have 
time together. You have desire instead of time. The couple 
separated by distance. The connection that survives on 
longing alone.

---

## Fm7♭5
**Notes:** F + Ab + B + Eb
**Domains:** Nature + Spirit + Time + Home

> **"The physical world touched by the sacred, in time, 
sheltering."**

F minor's body-in-sacred-world, but the foundation 
(C=Self) has crumbled to B (Time). The self has been 
replaced by temporality. The body in the temple is no 
longer personal — it is impermanent. The shelter endures 
but the self within it is passing.

---

## F#m7♭5
**Notes:** F# + A + C + E
**Domains:** Unknown + Knowledge + Self + Emotion

> **"Mystery partially known, personal, and deeply felt."**

F# minor's scholarly frontier, but the foundation 
(C#=Boundary) has crumbled to C (Self). The border between 
known and unknown has become the self. You ARE the frontier. 
The boundary runs through your own being. What you don't 
know is inseparable from who you are.

---

## Gm7♭5
**Notes:** G + Bb + Db + F
**Domains:** Connection + Desire + Boundary + Nature

> **"Togetherness wanted but walled off in the physical 
world."**

G minor's wanted-connection-in-action, but the foundation 
(D=Action) has crumbled to Db (Boundary). Movement has 
become obstruction. You can't reach the togetherness you 
want. The physical world separates instead of connects.

---

## Am7♭5
**Notes:** A + C + Eb + G
**Domains:** Knowledge + Self + Home + Connection

> **"Understanding through self and belonging and others — 
but the felt foundation has crumbled."**

Am7's wisdom, but the emotional foundation (E=Emotion) has 
shifted to Home (Eb). What was felt is now merely inhabited. 
Active understanding has become passive dwelling. The wisdom 
is still there — self, home, connection — but the feeling 
that animated it has been replaced by the memory of 
belonging. You remember understanding. You don't feel it 
anymore.

In Autumn Leaves: THIS is the chord that marks the crossing 
from the bright world to the dark. Emotion becomes Home. 
The living feeling becomes a room you once lived in. The 
light goes out and the furniture remains.

---

## Bbm7♭5
**Notes:** Bb + Db + E + Ab
**Domains:** Desire + Boundary + Emotion + Spirit

> **"Wanting at a wall, felt deeply, touching the sacred."**

Bb minor's frustrated desire, now reaching the sacred — 
but the physical foundation (F=Nature) has crumbled to 
E (Emotion). The ground beneath your feet is no longer 
solid reality — it is pure feeling. The frustrated longing 
has become unmoored from the material world. Desire in 
free fall, blocked but feeling everything, touching 
something beyond.

---

## Bm7♭5
**Notes:** B + D + F + A
**Domains:** Time + Action + Nature + Knowledge

> **"Time in motion through the physical world, yielding 
understanding."**

Bm7's journey-through-time, but the foundation (F#=Unknown) 
has crumbled to F (Nature). The mystery has grounded itself. 
What was unknowable has become physical. The adventure has 
ended in plain reality. You traveled, you learned, and what 
you found was not magic — it was the world as it is.

---

# VII. DIMINISHED 7TH CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Minor 3rd + Diminished 5th + Diminished 7th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], maximum danger/instability*

*Diminished 7th chords divide the octave into four equal 
minor thirds. This means there are only THREE unique 
diminished 7th chords — each chord is shared by four 
roots. In Layer 2, this means four domains are in 
perfectly balanced tension. No domain dominates. No 
domain resolves. All four pull equally.*

---

## Set 1: Cdim7 = Ebdim7 = Gbdim7 = Adim7
**Notes:** C + Eb + Gb + A
**Domains:** Self + Home + Unknown + Knowledge

> **"The self between belonging and mystery, pulled 
toward understanding, with no resolution."**

Four domains in perfect symmetry: who I am (C), where I 
belong (Eb), what I don't know (Gb), and what I do know (A). 
All pulling equally. The existential crisis in its purest 
form — knowing and not-knowing, belonging and not-belonging, 
in perfect, unresolvable tension.

---

## Set 2: C#dim7 = Edim7 = Gdim7 = Bbdim7
**Notes:** C# + E + G + Bb
**Domains:** Boundary + Emotion + Connection + Desire

> **"A threshold made of feeling, togetherness, and 
longing — all in equal tension."**

The relational crisis. Boundary (C#), feeling (E), others 
(G), and wanting (Bb) — the four forces that govern every 
relationship, pulling equally, without resolution. The 
moment in a relationship where everything is at stake and 
nothing can be decided.

In Hedwig's Theme: C#dim appears as the "hidden threshold." 
In Layer 2, we can now see why it sounds like a magical 
portal — it contains the four forces (boundary, feeling, 
connection, desire) in perfect, centerless balance. It is 
the sound of a wall that is made of everything you need to 
walk through it.

---

## Set 3: Ddim7 = Fdim7 = Abdim7 = Bdim7
**Notes:** D + F + Ab + B
**Domains:** Action + Nature + Spirit + Time

> **"Movement through the physical world, touching the 
sacred, in time — all forces equal."**

The existential crisis of embodiment. Action (D), matter 
(F), spirit (Ab), and time (B) — the four forces that 
govern mortal existence, pulling equally. The body in the 
world under the sky with the clock running. This is the 
chord of mortality itself — the awareness that you are a 
physical being in a spiritual universe with finite time, 
and you must act.

---

# VIII. AUGMENTED TRIADS

*Structure: Root + Major 3rd + Augmented 5th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], excess/intensification*

*Augmented triads divide the octave into three equal major 
thirds. There are only FOUR unique augmented triads — each 
shared by three roots. In Layer 2, three domains expand 
equally outward without a center. The chord has no natural 
resolution because it has no natural root.*

---

## Set 1: Caug = Eaug = Abaug
**Notes:** C + E + Ab
**Domains:** Self + Emotion + Spirit

> **"The self expanding through feeling into the 
transcendent."**

Being, feeling, and the sacred — in equal, centerless 
expansion. The self becoming more than itself through 
emotion, reaching the spiritual. Ecstasy in the literal 
sense: standing outside yourself. The mystical experience. 
The artistic rapture. The moment feeling exceeds the 
container of the self and touches something beyond.

---

## Set 2: Dbaug = Faug = Aaug
**Notes:** Db + F + A
**Domains:** Boundary + Nature + Knowledge

> **"The physical world understood at its absolute limits."**

Science at the frontier. The boundary (Db) of what can be 
known (A) in the natural world (F), all pressing outward 
equally. The Hubble telescope. The particle accelerator. 
The moment of discovery that expands the boundary of the 
known physical universe.

In "Knowing": Aaug as "knowledge is infinite" — the 
augmented chord IS infinity. It expands in all directions 
equally. It has no center. It has no edge. It can resolve 
anywhere — which means it belongs everywhere.

---

## Set 3: Daug = F#aug = Bbaug
**Notes:** D + F# + Bb
**Domains:** Action + Unknown + Desire

> **"Doing reaching into mystery driven by wanting — 
in equal, obsessive expansion."**

The obsessive quest. Action, mystery, and desire expanding 
without limit or center. The explorer who can't stop 
exploring. The seeker who can't stop seeking. Don Quixote's 
chord — if he had one — would be this: action toward the 
unknown, fueled by desire, with no resolution in sight.

---

## Set 4: Ebaug = Gaug = Baug
**Notes:** Eb + G + B
**Domains:** Home + Connection + Time

> **"Belonging, togetherness, and time — expanding beyond 
limits."**

The domestic triad blown open. Home, people, and time, 
expanding equally. The family growing. The community 
spreading. Time stretching. The sense that belonging can 
be bigger than any single place, that togetherness can 
encompass more than any single group, that time is more 
than any single lifetime. Dynasty. Legacy. Civilization.

---

# IX. SUSPENDED CHORDS

*In sus chords, the 3rd — the note that defines major or 
minor — is replaced. In Layer 2, this means the domain 
that would define the chord's "color" is absent, replaced 
by an adjacent domain. The identity is unresolved.*

## SUS4 CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Perfect 4th + Perfect 5th*
*The 3rd is replaced by the 4th — the domain one step 
counterclockwise on the circle*

---

## Csus4
**Notes:** C + F + G
**Domains:** Self + Nature + Connection
**Missing:** E (Emotion)
**Replaced by:** F (Nature)

> **"A being defined by the physical world and others — 
but without feeling."**

The self exists in the world and with people, but cannot 
feel. Emotion has been replaced by physicality. The person 
who functions, who shows up, who is present in body and 
community — but is numb. Waiting for feeling to return.

---

## Dbsus4
**Notes:** Db + Gb + Ab
**Domains:** Boundary + Unknown + Spirit
**Missing:** F (Nature)
**Replaced by:** Gb (Unknown)

> **"A threshold between mystery and the sacred — without 
physical grounding."**

The boundary has lost its material reality. It is now 
purely spiritual and mysterious. An abstract threshold. 
A metaphysical limit. Not a wall you can touch but a 
concept you can only sense.

---

## Dsus4
**Notes:** D + G + A
**Domains:** Action + Connection + Knowledge
**Missing:** F# (Unknown)
**Replaced by:** G (Connection)

> **"Doing through others toward understanding — but 
without the unknown."**

The quest without mystery. Action that moves through 
community toward knowledge, but the unknown has been 
replaced by the social. You learn, but only from others, 
not from the void. The apprentice, not the explorer. 
The student, not the quester.

In Cervantes: the lance on the rack — action suspended, 
the unknown (F#) replaced by the familiar (G). The man 
who COULD quest but instead stays among his people.

---

## Ebsus4
**Notes:** Eb + Ab + Bb
**Domains:** Home + Spirit + Desire
**Missing:** G (Connection)
**Replaced by:** Ab (Spirit)

> **"A place of belonging, sacred, and longed for — but 
without community."**

Home without people. A sacred place you want to return 
to but that is empty. The childhood house, long vacated, 
still holy in memory, still desired, but no one is there.

---

## Esus4
**Notes:** E + A + B
**Domains:** Emotion + Knowledge + Time
**Missing:** G# (Spirit)
**Replaced by:** A (Knowledge)

> **"Feeling through understanding in time — but without 
the transcendent."**

Emotion grounded in knowledge and time but stripped of the 
spiritual. Feeling that knows what it is. Self-aware 
emotion. The therapist's version of feeling — understood, 
temporal, real, but not sacred. Analyzed rather than 
rapturous.

---

## Fsus4
**Notes:** F + Bb + C
**Domains:** Nature + Desire + Self
**Missing:** A (Knowledge)
**Replaced by:** Bb (Desire)

> **"The physical world, wanted, inhabited — but not 
understood."**

Living in the world and desiring it without comprehending 
it. The infant's experience. The animal's experience. 
Pure embodied wanting without knowledge.

---

## F#sus4
**Notes:** F# + B + C#
**Domains:** Unknown + Time + Boundary
**Missing:** A# (Desire)
**Replaced by:** B (Time)

> **"The unknown at a threshold in time — but without 
wanting."**

Mystery encountered at a border, at a specific moment, 
but without desire. Not seeking the unknown — merely 
finding it. Not wanting to cross — merely arriving at the 
edge. The accidental frontier.

---

## Gsus4
**Notes:** G + C + D
**Domains:** Connection + Self + Action
**Missing:** B (Time)
**Replaced by:** C (Self)

> **"Togetherness through self and action — but without 
time."**

Connection in the present only. No past, no future, no 
duration. A moment of togetherness that does not 
persist. The passing encounter. The stranger on the 
train. The conversation that changes you but will not 
last.

---

## Absus4
**Notes:** Ab + Db + Eb
**Domains:** Spirit + Boundary + Home
**Missing:** C (Self)
**Replaced by:** Db (Boundary)

> **"The sacred at a threshold of belonging — but without 
the individual."**

Transcendence without a self to experience it. The sacred 
space that exists whether or not you're there. The temple 
between services. The shrine with no pilgrim.

---

## Asus4
**Notes:** A + D + E
**Domains:** Knowledge + Action + Emotion
**Missing:** C# (Boundary) AND C (Self) — BOTH absent
**Replaced by:** D (Action)

> **"Understanding through doing and feeling — but 
without identity."**

Knowledge that lacks both the external wall (C#) and the 
internal self (C). This knowledge belongs to no one. It 
is neither confrontational nor personal. It is knowledge 
in the act of being generated — doing something and 
feeling what happens — without a subject to claim it.

In Cervantes: the narrator's signature chord. Knowledge 
without a fixed identity. The unreliable narrator — he 
knows through doing (he is telling the story) and feeling 
(he has emotions about the hidalgo) but he won't commit 
to a self (he won't give his name, won't fix the town's 
name, won't even fix the hidalgo's name). The sus4 is 
not just withholding — it is genuinely selfless. Not in 
the moral sense but in the ontological sense. The 
narrator has no fixed self.

---

## Bbsus4
**Notes:** Bb + Eb + F
**Domains:** Desire + Home + Nature
**Missing:** D (Action)
**Replaced by:** Eb (Home)

> **"Wanting, belonging, in the physical world — but 
without movement."**

Desire without the ability to act on it. Wanting something, 
being somewhere, in a real physical world, but unable to 
move. Paralyzed longing. The dream you can't pursue. The 
wish you can't enact.

---

## Bsus4
**Notes:** B + E + F#
**Domains:** Time + Emotion + Unknown
**Missing:** D# (Home)
**Replaced by:** E (Emotion)

> **"Time, feeling, and mystery — but without belonging."**

The wanderer in time. Feeling everything, encountering 
mystery, moving through time — but with no place to 
return to. Home has been replaced by feeling. The person 
who feels instead of belongs. The eternal traveler.

---

## SUS2 CHORDS

*Structure: Root + Major 2nd + Perfect 5th*
*The 3rd is replaced by the 2nd — the domain one step 
clockwise on the circle*

---

## Csus2
**Notes:** C + D + G
**Domains:** Self + Action + Connection
**Missing:** E (Emotion)
**Replaced by:** D (Action)

> **"A being defined by doing and others — but without 
feeling."**

The self known through work and community, not through 
feeling. Identity as function. You are what you do and 
who you're with, not what you feel.

In Cervantes: the hidalgo's unfixed name. The self 
defined by action (D) and his few connections (G), but 
missing emotion (E) entirely. The name won't settle 
because the feeling hasn't arrived yet.

---

## Dbsus2
**Notes:** Db + Eb + Ab
**Domains:** Boundary + Home + Spirit
**Missing:** F (Nature)
**Replaced by:** Eb (Home)

> **"A threshold between belonging and the sacred — 
without physical grounding."**

The border that is felt as a sense of home and 
transcendence, but has no material reality. A spiritual 
boundary, not a physical one.

---

## Dsus2
**Notes:** D + E + A
**Domains:** Action + Emotion + Knowledge
**Missing:** F# (Unknown)
**Replaced by:** E (Emotion)

> **"Doing through feeling toward understanding — without 
mystery."**

Action driven by emotion, yielding knowledge, but with 
no encounter with the unknown. Learning through passion 
rather than through exploration. The romantic, not the 
scientist. The poet, not the explorer.

---

## Ebsus2
**Notes:** Eb + F + Bb
**Domains:** Home + Nature + Desire
**Missing:** G (Connection)
**Replaced by:** F (Nature)

> **"A place of belonging in the physical world, longed 
for — without community."**

Home as landscape, not as people. The place itself is 
desired — the soil, the sky, the rooms — but the 
people are absent. Nostalgia for a place, not for the 
people in it.

---

## Esus2
**Notes:** E + F# + B
**Domains:** Emotion + Unknown + Time
**Missing:** G# (Spirit)
**Replaced by:** F# (Unknown)

> **"Feeling toward the unknown across time — without 
the transcendent."**

Emotion reaching into mystery through time, but without 
spiritual framing. Not awe — curiosity. Not worship — 
wonder. The scientist's passion. The child's "why?"

---

## Fsus2
**Notes:** F + G + C
**Domains:** Nature + Connection + Self
**Missing:** A (Knowledge)
**Replaced by:** G (Connection)

> **"The physical world, shared, inhabited — without 
understanding."**

Living in the world with others but not comprehending it. 
Community in nature without knowledge. The tribe before 
science. The garden before naming. Innocence.

---

## F#sus2
**Notes:** F# + G# + C#
**Domains:** Unknown + Spirit + Boundary
**Missing:** A# (Desire)
**Replaced by:** G# (Spirit)

> **"The unknown, sacred, at a threshold — without 
wanting."**

Mystery encountered at a spiritual boundary, but without 
desire to cross it or claim it. Pure encounter. No agenda. 
No wanting. Just the awareness that something unknowable 
exists.

---

## Gsus2
**Notes:** G + A + D
**Domains:** Connection + Knowledge + Action
**Missing:** B (Time)
**Replaced by:** A (Knowledge)

> **"Togetherness through understanding and doing — 
without time."**

Connection that is known and enacted but has no temporal 
dimension. Understanding each other in this moment, 
acting together now, but with no history and no future. 
The committee. The task force. The team assembled for one 
purpose.

---

## Absus2
**Notes:** Ab + Bb + Eb
**Domains:** Spirit + Desire + Home
**Missing:** C (Self)
**Replaced by:** Bb (Desire)

> **"The sacred longed for and sheltering — without 
the individual."**

Transcendence desired and domestic, but impersonal. The 
religion that wants to welcome and shelter, but has lost 
the individual. The institution that cares for souls but 
doesn't see persons.

---

## Asus2
**Notes:** A + B + E
**Domains:** Knowledge + Time + Emotion
**Missing:** C# (Boundary) AND C (Self)
**Replaced by:** B (Time)

> **"Understanding across time through feeling — without 
a self or a wall to push against."**

Knowledge that is temporal and emotional but has no 
identity and no resistance. Wisdom that accumulates 
through time and feeling, belonging to no one. The river 
of understanding that flows through everyone. Collective 
knowledge. Cultural memory. The tradition that knows 
even though no individual understands.

---

## Bbsus2
**Notes:** Bb + C + F
**Domains:** Desire + Self + Nature
**Missing:** D (Action)
**Replaced by:** C (Self)

> **"Wanting, being, in the physical world — without 
movement."**

Desire that is entirely internal. The wanting is real, 
the self is present, the world is there — but there is 
no action. Daydreaming. Wishing. Imagining without doing.

---

## Bsus2
**Notes:** B + C# + F#
**Domains:** Time + Boundary + Unknown
**Missing:** D# (Home)
**Replaced by:** C# (Boundary)

> **"Time at a threshold facing the unknown — without 
belonging."**

The moment of crossing without a place to return to. 
Leaving without a home behind you. The emigrant. The 
exile. The one-way trip into the unknown.

---

# X. POWER CHORDS (FIFTHS)

*Structure: Root + Perfect 5th only*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root]! — raw, imperative, stripped*
*Layer 2 reading: two domains only — the most 
fundamental pairing, without any modifier or color*

*Power chords contain no 3rd — which means no 
major/minor distinction. In Layer 2, the color-domain 
is absent. What remains is the ROOT and its structural 
partner — the irreducible pair.*

---

| Chord | Notes | Domains | Reading |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| **C5** | C + G | Self + Connection | *The self and its bond to others — raw, unqualified* |
| **Db5** | Db + Ab | Boundary + Spirit | *The limit and the sacred — where physics meets metaphysics* |
| **D5** | D + A | Action + Knowledge | *Doing and knowing — the most basic human agency* |
| **Eb5** | Eb + Bb | Home + Desire | *Belonging and wanting — the two forces of exile* |
| **E5** | E + B | Emotion + Time | *Feeling and time — the two ingredients of memory* |
| **F5** | F + C | Nature + Self | *The world and the being within it — embodiment* |
| **F#5** | F# + C# | Unknown + Boundary | *Mystery and its edge — the frontier itself* |
| **G5** | G + D | Connection + Action | *Others and doing — togetherness as activity* |
| **Ab5** | Ab + Eb | Spirit + Home | *The sacred and its dwelling — the temple* |
| **A5** | A + E | Knowledge + Emotion | *Understanding and feeling — the irreducible pair* |
| **Bb5** | Bb + F | Desire + Nature | *Wanting and the world — hunger* |
| **B5** | B + F# | Time + Unknown | *Time and mystery — the future* |

### A5: The "Knowing" Chord

**A + E = Knowledge + Emotion.**

In the "Knowing" composition, the entire piece resolves 
to this chord — after Am (Knowledge+Self+Emotion) 
transforms to A (Knowledge+Boundary+Emotion) and then 
the third is removed entirely, leaving only the root and 
fifth.

What remains when you strip away the question of whether 
knowledge is personal (Am) or confrontational (A)? 
**The irreducible pair: understanding and feeling.** They 
are the same act. They always were. The distinction 
between knowing-through-self and knowing-through-boundary 
was never the point. The point is that knowing IS feeling, 
and feeling IS knowing, and this power chord — raw, 
uncolored, stripped of every modifier — says only that.

---

# XI. 6TH CHORDS

*Structure (Major 6th): Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th + Major 6th*
*Structure (Minor 6th): Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th + Major 6th*
*Layer 1 reading: [Root], with preserved sweetness/nostalgia*
*Layer 2 reading: four domains, with the 6th adding one 
additional domain — always the note two positions clockwise 
on the circle of fifths (the root's "grandchild")*

---

## Major 6th Chords

| Chord | Notes | Domains | Reading |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| **C6** | C+E+G+A | Self+Emotion+Connection+Knowledge | *A being that feels, connects, and understands — complete awareness* |
| **D6** | D+F#+A+B | Action+Unknown+Knowledge+Time | *The quest through time — adventure with temporal awareness* |
| **Eb6** | Eb+G+Bb+C | Home+Connection+Desire+Self | *Belonging with others, wanted, inhabited by the self — full domestic life* |
| **F6** | F+A+C+D | Nature+Knowledge+Self+Action | *The world understood, inhabited, and acted upon — mastery* |
| **G6** | G+B+D+E | Connection+Time+Action+Emotion | *Togetherness across time, through doing, with feeling — love in action* |
| **A6** | A+C#+E+F# | Knowledge+Boundary+Emotion+Unknown | *Understanding confrontational, felt, facing mystery — the edge of wisdom* |
| **Bb6** | Bb+D+F+G | Desire+Action+Nature+Connection | *Wanting, doing, in the world, with others — community aspiration* |

### G6 — The Fullest Relational Chord

G6 = Connection + Time + Action + Emotion. 

Togetherness that persists through time, is expressed 
through doing, and is felt. This is what a good marriage 
sounds like. What a deep friendship sounds like. What 
community sounds like when it works.

---

## Minor 6th Chords

| Chord | Notes | Domains | Reading |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| **Cm6** | C+Eb+G+A | Self+Home+Connection+Knowledge | *A self that belongs, connects, and understands — but has replaced feeling with place* |
| **Dm6** | D+F+A+B | Action+Nature+Knowledge+Time | *Doing in the world, learning, through time — a career, a practice, a lifetime of work* |
| **Em6** | E+G+B+C# | Emotion+Connection+Time+Boundary | *Feeling through relationship across time, at a limit — love that has met its wall* |
| **Fm6** | F+Ab+C+D | Nature+Spirit+Self+Action | *The world sacred, inhabited, acted upon — the monk at work, the craftsman at prayer* |
| **Gm6** | G+Bb+D+E | Connection+Desire+Action+Emotion | *Togetherness wanted, pursued, and felt — "gone, but something sweet remains"* |
| **Am6** | A+C+E+F# | Knowledge+Self+Emotion+Unknown | *Understanding personal, felt, facing the unknown — wisdom at its limit* |

### Gm6 — The Autumn Leaves Resolution

Gm6 = Connection + Desire + Action + Emotion.

The final chord of Autumn Leaves' descent. In Layer 1: 
"connection lost, with sweetness preserved." In Layer 2: 
togetherness that is still desired (Bb), still expressed 
in doing (D), and still felt (E). The connection is 
"minor" — the experience of time (B) has become the 
experience of longing (Bb) — but four active forces 
remain: the relationship, the want, the effort, and the 
feeling.

The sweetness inside the Gm6 is not vague nostalgia. It 
is the specific, active persistence of desire, action, 
and emotion even after the temporal dimension of 
togetherness has collapsed into longing. You don't have 
the time anymore. But you still want, still do, still 
feel.

That is why the chord is not just sad. It is beautiful.

# XII. READING GUIDE — PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

## The Three Questions

For any chord, ask:

**1. What does it contain?** (List all notes → list all domains)

**2. What did it transform from?** (Compare to its major/minor 
parallel → identify the differential)

**3. What is missing?** (For sus chords: what domain was replaced? 
For power chords: what was stripped away?)

## Example: Full Reading of Am7♭5

**Step 1: Contents**
A + C + Eb + G = Knowledge + Self + Home + Connection

**Step 2: Differential from Am7**
Am7 = A + C + E + G = Knowledge + Self + **Emotion** + Connection
Am7♭5 = A + C + **Eb** + G = Knowledge + Self + **Home** + Connection

E → Eb = Emotion → Home
"What was felt has become merely a place. Active 
understanding has become passive dwelling."

**Step 3: Differential from A7 (the parallel dominant)**
A7 = A + C# + E + G = Knowledge + **Boundary** + Emotion + Connection
Am7♭5 = A + C + Eb + G = Knowledge + **Self** + Home + Connection

Two shifts: C# → C (Boundary → Self) AND E → Eb (Emotion → Home)
"The external resistance has collapsed into the self. 
The active feeling has settled into belonging. What 
was confrontational knowledge is now personal memory."

**Full reading:**
"Understanding that was once won through confrontation 
and felt deeply has collapsed inward — the wall became 
the self, the feeling became a place — and now all that 
remains is personal knowledge, self-awareness, belonging, 
and connection to others. The wisdom is still there. The 
fire that forged it has gone out."

**In Autumn Leaves:**
This is the chord where the bright world ends. The fire 
goes out. The feeling becomes a room. The boundary becomes 
a person sitting in that room, remembering.

## Appendix: Chord Families by Shared Content

Chords that share the same notes (in different combinations) 
form **semantic families** — groups of chords that speak 
about the same domains from different perspectives:

### The Self-Emotion-Connection Family (C, E, G)

| Chord | Arrangement | Perspective |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| C major | Root = Self | "I feel and connect" |
| Em | Root = Emotion | "I feel through connection and time" |
| Am | Contains C+E | "I know through self and feeling" |
| C6 | Contains C+E+G+A | "I feel, connect, and understand" |

All of these chords share Self, Emotion, and/or Connection 
as constituent domains. They are the vocabulary of the 
personal, the felt, the relational. Music that stays within 
this family is music about the inner life among others.

### The Action-Unknown-Knowledge Family (D, F#, A)

| Chord | Arrangement | Perspective |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| D major | Root = Action | "I act toward mystery and understanding" |
| F#m | Root = Unknown | "Mystery partially understood at a threshold" |
| Bm | Contains D+F# | "Time in motion toward the unknown" |
| Bbmaj7 | Contains D+F+A | "Desire moving through the world toward understanding" |

The vocabulary of the quest, the journey, the search for 
meaning through doing.

### The Home-Connection-Desire Family (Eb, G, Bb)

| Chord | Arrangement | Perspective |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Eb major | Root = Home | "Belonging shared and longed for" |
| Gm | Root = Connection | "Togetherness wanted and pursued" |
| Ebmaj7 | Contains Eb+G+Bb+D | "Belonging built through desire and action" |

The vocabulary of community, longing, and place.
