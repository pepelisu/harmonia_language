## How to Read a Chord (Both Layers)

```
Step 1 (Layer 1):  Root + Quality = quick meaning
Step 2 (Layer 2):  List all notes → list all domains → 
                   read as simultaneous meanings
Step 3 (Differential): What note changed from major/minor? 
                       What domain transformed?
```

**Example: Em in Hedwig's Theme**

```
Layer 1:  E(Emotion) + minor(absent) = "Something is 
          missing in my heart"

Layer 2:  E+G+B = Emotion+Connection+Time = "Feeling 
          through relationship across time"

Differential: G# became G = Spirit became Connection = 
              "What could have been transcendent became 
              human relationship instead"

Together: "A felt absence — specifically of connection 
          across time — where the sacred has become the 
          human. An orphan's story."
