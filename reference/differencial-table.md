# Differential Table — Major ↔ Minor Transformations

When a chord shifts from major to minor, the third drops by 
one half step. In Harmonia, this transforms one semantic 
domain into an adjacent one.

## The Twelve Transformations

| Chord | Major 3rd | Minor 3rd | Domain Change | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **C** | E | Eb | Emotion → Home | Feeling becomes belonging. The heart seeks a place. |
| **Db** | F | E | Nature → Emotion | The physical becomes the felt. The world becomes a feeling. |
| **D** | F# | F | Unknown → Nature | Mystery becomes the physical. Possibility grounds itself. |
| **Eb** | G | Gb | Connection → Unknown | Community dissolves into mystery. The known becomes unknowable. |
| **E** | G# | G | Spirit → Connection | The transcendent becomes the social. What was sacred becomes human. |
| **F** | A | Ab | Knowledge → Spirit | Understanding becomes mystery. What was known dissolves into awe. |
| **F#** | A# | A | Desire → Knowledge | Wanting becomes knowing. The longing transforms into understanding. |
| **G** | B | Bb | Time → Desire | What was experienced becomes what is longed for. The past becomes a wish. |
| **Ab** | C | B | Self → Time | The individual dissolves into impermanence. Being becomes passing. |
| **A** | C# | C | Boundary → Self | External resistance becomes internal experience. The wall becomes the person. |
| **Bb** | D | Db | Action → Boundary | Movement meets a wall. Doing becomes blocked. |
| **B** | D# | D | Home → Action | Belonging becomes movement. The settled becomes the restless. |

## Reading the Table

### Forward (Major → Minor = Darkening)

"When [root domain] shifts from major to minor, 
[major 3rd domain] transforms into [minor 3rd domain]."

Example: "When Connection (G) shifts from major to minor, 
Time (B) transforms into Desire (Bb). What was experienced 
becomes what is longed for."

### Reverse (Minor → Major = Brightening)

"When [root domain] shifts from minor to major, 
[minor 3rd domain] transforms into [major 3rd domain]."

Example: "When Knowledge (A) shifts from minor to major, 
Self (C) transforms into Boundary (C#). Internal experience 
becomes external confrontation. Private knowing becomes 
tested knowing."

## Applied Examples from Existing Translations

| Piece | Key | Differential | What It Explains |
|-------|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **Für Elise** | Am | Boundary→Self | Beethoven's knowledge is personal, internal, embodied — not confrontational |
| **Etta James** | A major | Self→Boundary | Etta's knowledge is confrontational, battle-won, external — she hit the wall |
| **Hedwig's Theme** | Em | Spirit→Connection | The story is about human relationships, not transcendence |
| **Autumn Leaves** | Gm | Time→Desire | What was lived becomes what is longed for — memory becomes yearning |
| **Donne** | G major | Desire→Time | Connection is affirmed IN time, not merely wished for |
| **Don Quixote** | F major | Spirit→Knowledge | The physical world is known, not mystified — plain reality |
| **"Knowing"** | Am→A→A5 | Boundary↔Self, then both removed | The distinction between external and internal knowledge dissolves |

## The Symmetry

Note that each pair of differential opposites sits across the 
circle of fifths:

- C: **Emotion↔Home** — and Emotion(E) and Home(Eb) are 
  tritone partners of Desire(Bb) and Unknown(F#)
- G: **Time↔Desire** — the experience and the longing for it
- A: **Boundary↔Self** — the external and the internal

Each major/minor shift moves between two concepts that are 
**adjacent on the circle.** This means the half step in 
pitch corresponds to the smallest possible step in meaning. 
Major-to-minor is always the SMALLEST conceptual 
transformation — never a leap across the circle, always a 
single step to the neighboring domain.

This structural constraint is what gives the differential 
system its coherence. It is not arbitrary which domain 
transforms into which. The adjacency of the circle of 
fifths determines it.
