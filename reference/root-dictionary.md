### Adjacency Relationships

Because the circle of fifths creates natural harmonic relationships, **adjacent roots share semantic affinity:**

| Adjacent Pair | Shared Meaning | Why |
|---|---|---|
| C ↔ G | Self and Others | Identity is formed through connection |
| G ↔ D | People and Action | We act upon each other |
| D ↔ A | Doing and Knowing | Action produces understanding |
| A ↔ E | Mind and Heart | Thought and feeling intertwine |
| E ↔ B | Feeling and Time | Emotions live in time, memories are feelings preserved |
| B ↔ F# | Time and the Unknown | The future is time's unknown territory |
| F# ↔ Db | The Unknown and Boundaries | Where the unknown meets the known, there is a border |
| Db ↔ Ab | Boundaries and Spirit | The edge of the known touches the transcendent |
| Ab ↔ Eb | Spirit and Home | Sacred spaces are where we feel we belong |
| Eb ↔ Bb | Home and Desire | We long for where we belong |
| Bb ↔ F | Desire and Nature | Need is rooted in the body |
| F ↔ C | Nature and Self | The body is the ground of being |

### Tritone Oppositions

Notes separated by a **tritone** (6 semitones — the maximum harmonic distance) carry **complementary or opposing** meanings:

| Root | Tritone Partner | Opposition |
|---|---|---|
| C (Self) ↔ F#/Gb (Unknown) | Who I am vs. What I might become |
| G (Connection) ↔ Db (Conflict) | Togetherness vs. Division |
| D (Action) ↔ Ab (Spirit) | The physical act vs. The metaphysical |
| A (Knowledge) ↔ Eb (Home) | What I know vs. Where I belong |
| E (Emotion) ↔ Bb (Desire) | What I feel vs. What I want |
| B (Time) ↔ F (Nature) | Change vs. The eternal physical world |

These oppositions are **productive** — when a tritone appears in a chord or progression, it creates tension between the two opposing domains. The tritone in music is called *diabolus in musica* — the most unstable interval. In Harmonia, it is the sound of **two truths pulling against each other.**
