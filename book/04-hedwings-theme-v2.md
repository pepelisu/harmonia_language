# Chapter 4: Hedwig's Theme — Polyphonic Analysis (v2.0)

## A Note on Versions

This chapter exists in two versions. The [v1.1 analysis](04-hedwigs-theme.md) 
reads each chord as root + quality — a single domain 
modified. It remains valid as a first-pass reading.

This v2.0 analysis reads every note inside every chord as 
an independent carrier of meaning. The results are deeper, 
more structurally constrained, and — in at least one case — 
genuinely startling.

Both analyses use the same source material: the opening 
section of John Williams' Hedwig's Theme, from *Harry Potter 
and the Philosopher's Stone* (2001).

## The Key: E Minor — Three Domains, Not One

### v1.1 Reading

E minor = Emotion (E) + absent (minor) = "Something is 
missing in my heart."

### v2.0 Reading

E minor contains three notes: **E + G + B.**

| Note | Domain |
|------|--------|
| E | Emotion, Feeling |
| G | Connection, People, Togetherness |
| B | Time, Change |

**"Feeling through relationship across time."**

This is not just "an emotion that is absent." It is a 
specific KIND of emotional experience — one that exists in 
the context of other people and unfolds through time. This 
is not abstract feeling. This is not private interiority. 
This is **relational, temporal emotion** — the kind of 
feeling that requires both others and duration.

Love. Grief. Loyalty. Friendship. Growing up.

These are all emotions that cannot exist in isolation or in 
a single moment. They require Connection (G) — someone to 
feel toward. And they require Time (B) — duration across 
which the feeling develops, deepens, is tested, transforms.

The key of E minor doesn't just say "something is missing." 
It says: **"This is a story about feeling, connection, and 
time."**

Those are the three pillars of the Harry Potter series.

### The Differential: What Changed from Major to Minor?

E major = E + **G#** + B = Emotion + **Spirit** + Time
E minor = E + **G** + B = Emotion + **Connection** + Time

**G# became G. Spirit became Connection.**

The transcendent became the social. What could have been a 
story about spiritual transcendence — about a chosen one 
ascending to a higher plane, achieving enlightenment, 
touching God — became instead a story about **human 
relationships.** The sacred (G#) transformed into the 
communal (G).

Harry Potter is not a story about transcendence. It is a 
story about friendship, loyalty, love between imperfect 
people, and the community that forms around a shared 
struggle. The magic is real — but the magic is not the 
point. The people are the point.

E major would have given us a myth. A parable. A story 
about a boy who ascends.

E minor gives us a story about a boy who **belongs.**

The half step from G# to G — Spirit to Connection — is the 
half step between a religious epic and Harry Potter. Between 
a saint's life and a boarding school story. Between heaven 
and the Gryffindor common room.

Williams chose E minor. And in that choice, before a single 
note of melody was written, the entire emotional architecture 
of the series was established: **this will be about feeling 
through connection across time, where the transcendent has 
become the human.**

## The Meter: 3/4 — Incantation

Unchanged from v1.1: the waltz meter spins, circles, lifts 
off the ground. Harmonia reads 3/4 as **spellcasting.** Every 
phrase in this piece is an incantation, not a declaration.

## The Voice: Celesta — The Otherworldly Speaker

Unchanged from v1.1: the celesta is a voice from beyond the 
veil. Not human. Not entirely of this world. Magic itself, 
whispering.

## The Dynamic: Pianissimo — A Secret

Unchanged: this is whispered. Intimate. Meant for one person.

---

## The Melody — Note by Note (v2.0)

The melody is unchanged from v1.1 — each note still carries 
its root domain. But now we can read how each melodic note 
**interacts with the chord sounding beneath it,** creating 
polyphonic meaning: the melody says one thing while the 
harmony says several things simultaneously.

### First Phrase

```
Melody:  B   E . G   F#    E    B↑    A        F#
Chord:   |── Em ──|── Em ──|── C ──|── Cmaj7 ──|
```

#### Beat 1: B over Em

| Layer | Notes | Domains |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melody | B | Time |
| Chord | E + G + B | Emotion + Connection + Time |

The melody begins on **B (Time)** — the same note that is 
already inside the Em chord. The melody and the harmony 
**agree.** The first word is Time, and it is confirmed by 
the harmony that contains it.

> *"Once upon a time..."*

But this B is not just "time" in isolation. It sounds 
WITHIN a chord that contains Emotion and Connection. So the 
Time is not empty or abstract. It is time that already 
contains feeling and togetherness, even though the melody 
hasn't reached those notes yet. The harmony **foreshadows** 
what the melody will discover: that time, in this story, is 
never empty. It is always filled with feeling and connection.

The first note and the first chord, read together:

> *"In time — time that already holds feeling and 
> togetherness, though the speaker doesn't know it yet."*

#### Beats 2–3: E.G F# over Em

| Layer | Notes | Domains |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melody | E, G, F# | Emotion, Connection, Unknown |
| Chord | E + G + B | Emotion + Connection + Time |

The melody touches **E (Emotion)** and **G (Connection)** — 
both of which are inside the chord. The melody is exploring 
the contents of its own harmony. It is discovering what the 
chord already knows: that this time contains feeling and 
togetherness.

Then the melody reaches **F# (The Unknown)** — a note that 
is **NOT in the Em chord.** For the first time, the melody 
says something the harmony doesn't contain. The Unknown is 
outside the harmonic frame. It is a **foreign concept** 
within the established world of Emotion-Connection-Time.

> *"A feeling reaches toward connection... and touches 
> something unknown — something the world of this chord 
> cannot contain."*

The F# is the first sign that the established emotional 
world (Em) is not sufficient. Something exists outside it. 
Something the melody can reach but the chord cannot hold.

#### Beats 4–5: E B↑ over Em / C

| Layer | Notes | Domains |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melody | E, then B (high) | Emotion, then Time (future) |
| Chord shifts | Em → C | Emotion+Connection+Time → Self+Emotion+Connection |

The melody returns to E (Emotion) and then **leaps** to a 
high B (Time, in a higher octave — future tense).

This is the breathless moment. The perfect fifth leap 
(E to B) is the widest, most open interval in the phrase. 
In v1.1, this was read as "feeling leaps into future time." 
In v2.0, we can read more:

The leap happens as the chord changes from **Em to C.**

**Em = Emotion + Connection + Time**
**C = Self + Emotion + Connection**

What changed? **B (Time) left the chord and C (Self) 
entered.**

At the exact moment the melody leaps into future Time (B↑), 
the harmony **removes Time and introduces Self.** The 
melody is reaching for the future while the harmony is 
saying: the future is not about time. The future is about 
**a self arriving.**

The melody says: "Time!"
The harmony says: "Self."

They are both right. What is coming — what the future holds 
— is not more time. It is a person. A self. Harry.

> *"The feeling leaps toward the future — and the future 
> answers: what is coming is not time. What is coming is 
> a self. A person who will feel and connect."*

#### Beats 6–7: A over C, F# over Cmaj7

| Layer | Notes | Domains |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melody | A (held) | Knowledge |
| Chord | C = Self + Emotion + Connection | |

The melody lands on **A (Knowledge)** — a note NOT in the C 
chord. Knowledge is foreign to the world of 
Self-Emotion-Connection. It exists outside the established 
harmony. It is something the self-that-feels-and-connects 
**does not yet possess.**

> *"Waiting to be understood — but understanding is not 
> yet part of this world."*

Then:

| Layer | Notes | Domains |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Melody | F# (held) | The Unknown |
| Chord | Cmaj7 = Self + Emotion + Connection + Time | |

**Cmaj7 = C + E + G + B = Self + Emotion + Connection + Time**

This is the most important chord in the first phrase. In 
v2.0, it contains **all four "inner" domains**: Self, 
Emotion, Connection, Time. It is the complete human 
situation. Life itself.

And over this chord — over this chord that contains 
everything a life needs — the melody holds **F# (The 
Unknown).** The one domain NOT in the chord.

The fullest possible description of human experience 
(Self + Emotion + Connection + Time) is sounding. And 
the melody says: even with all of this — even with being, 
feeling, belonging, and time — there is still something 
you don't know. Something outside. Something missing.

> *"Life is complete — self, feeling, connection, time — 
> and yet. Still a mystery. Still unknown."*

This is the condition of every child before they discover 
what they are. Every muggle-born before the letter arrives. 
Every orphan before they learn who their parents were. Life 
is full — and there is still a door you haven't opened.

The Cmaj7 is the complete life. The F# is the unopened 
letter.

---

### Second Phrase — The Threshold

```
Melody:  E . G   F#    D#    F     B
Chord:   |── Em ──|── C#dim ──|── Bm ──|
```

#### Beats 1–2: E.G F# over Em (reprise)

The same gesture as before: Emotion reaches toward 
Connection, touches the Unknown. The phrase repeats its 
question.

#### Beat 3: D# over C#dim — THE THRESHOLD

This is the structural and emotional center of the entire 
theme. Let me take it apart completely.

**The melody note: D# / Eb = Home, Shelter, Belonging**

**The chord: C#dim = C# + E + G**

| Note | Domain |
|------|--------|
| C# / Db | Boundary, Threshold, Conflict |
| E | Emotion, Feeling |
| G | Connection, People |

v2.0 polyphonic reading of C#dim:

> **"A threshold made of feeling and togetherness."**

The diminished chord — the most unstable, most tense 
chord in Western harmony — is, in its polyphonic 
content, a boundary that is composed of the two things 
needed to cross it: emotion and connection.

The wall between the muggle world and the wizarding world 
is not made of brick. It is made of **feeling and 
relationship.** You don't break through it with force. You 
walk through it with love. With friendship. With belonging.

Hagrid doesn't blast down a wall. He tells Harry who he is. 
The Dursleys' hold on Harry doesn't end through violence. 
It ends through **connection** — the arrival of someone 
who says "you belong somewhere else." The barrier is 
emotional and relational, and so is its dissolution.

The C#dim chord contains Boundary + Emotion + Connection. 
The wall is made of the key to the wall.

Now: the melody note over this chord is **D# (Home).**

D# is NOT in the chord. Home is **foreign** to the 
threshold. It exists outside the boundary's structure. 
It is what lies on the other side — visible, felt, but 
not yet reached.

> *"At a threshold made of feeling and togetherness, 
> home appears — outside the boundary, not yet reached, 
> but visible."*

#### D# as a Foreign Note in E Minor

D# does not belong to the natural E minor scale. It appears 
only in the **harmonic minor** — a scale that raises the 
7th degree to create a leading tone. The D# is a visitor. 
An intruder. A note from another scale.

In v2.0: **Home (D#/Eb) does not belong in this key.**

The key — the world of Emotion-Connection-Time — has no 
natural place for Home. Home is foreign. It appears for 
one beat, shows itself, and vanishes. An orphan's 
experience: home is something glimpsed, not possessed. 
Something that enters the frame briefly and then 
disappears.

Until someone tells you it was always there. One half 
step away.

#### Beat 4: F over C#dim — The Physical World

**F = Nature, Physical World**

The melody steps from D# to F. One half step. **Home to 
the Physical World.** The smallest interval in music. The 
thinnest possible wall.

In v2.0, both D# and F carry specific domain meanings:
- D# = Home, Shelter, Belonging
- F = Nature, Body, Physical World

**Home and the Physical World are separated by one 
semitone.** They are adjacent. Almost the same. 
Distinguished by the smallest possible difference.

And the chord beneath them — **C#dim** — is a threshold 
made of feeling and connection.

Assembled:

> *"Home and the physical world are separated by the 
> thinnest possible wall. And the wall between them is 
> made of feeling and connection."*

This is Platform 9¾. Not metaphorically. Structurally. 
The magical home (D#) is one half step from the mundane 
physical world (F). The barrier between them (C#dim) is 
made of Emotion (E) and Connection (G). You cross it not 
by running at a wall but by **feeling your way through a 
boundary that is itself made of love and belonging.**

In v1.1, the observation was: "the half step between D# 
and F is Platform 9¾." That was a metaphor — compelling 
but interpretive.

In v2.0, we can read the chord that sounds DURING that 
half step. The chord is a boundary made of emotion and 
connection. The metaphor now has structural support: the 
wall's composition (feeling + togetherness) is specified 
by the chord's polyphonic content, not just by the 
analyst's imagination.

Does this mean Williams intended Platform 9¾? No. Does it 
mean the music "contains" this reading objectively? Not 
exactly. But the structural alignment between the 
narrative element (a threshold crossed through love and 
belonging) and the harmonic element (a threshold-chord 
containing emotion and connection, with home and the 
physical world one half step apart) is tighter than any 
v1.1 reading could reveal.

The polyphonic layer doesn't prove the reading. But it 
constrains it. The C#dim chord doesn't just "sound 
unstable." It contains specific domains — Boundary, 
Emotion, Connection — that align with a specific 
narrative function. This alignment may be coincidence. 
But it is a richer, more constrained coincidence than 
"the diminished chord sounds tense."

#### The Tritone: F to B

After D# → F (home to physical world, one half step), the 
melody moves from **F to B** — a tritone. The most 
dissonant interval. The *diabolus in musica.*

F = Nature, Physical World
B = Time, Change

In v2.0, the tritone connects two **opposing domains** 
(Nature and Time are tritone partners on the Harmonia 
circle — "Change vs. the enduring physical world").

> *"The physical world and time collide. Reality bends. 
> The enduring meets the impermanent. Something 
> impossible happens."*

The tritone IS the moment of magic. Not "magic" as 
sparkles and wands, but magic as the collision of two 
ordinarily incompatible forces — the stable physical 
world and the passage of time that transforms everything. 
When they collide in a tritone, the result is maximum 
instability — maximum transformation — maximum *change.*

The wall gives way. The platform appears. The train is 
waiting.

#### Beat 5: B over Bm — Time Set in Motion

**Bm = B + D + F# = Time + Action + Unknown**

> **"Time set in motion, heading into the unknowable."**

The final chord of the opening passage. In v1.1: "what 
was lost in time." In v2.0: something much more dynamic.

**Time (B)** is the root — time has taken center stage. 
It is no longer a background note inside the Em chord. 
It is the foundation.

**Action (D)** has entered for the first time. Until now, 
no chord contained D. Nothing was DOING anything. The 
music was feeling, connecting, and existing in time, but 
it was not acting. Now, at last, action arrives. Something 
begins to move.

**The Unknown (F#)** — the note the melody kept reaching 
for, the note that was always outside the Em chord, the 
unopened letter — is now **inside the harmony.** It has 
been absorbed into the structure. The Unknown is no longer 
foreign. It has become part of the world.

> *"Time has begun. Action has started. And the unknown — 
> the mystery that was always outside, always glimpsed 
> but never held — has become part of the world. It 
> belongs now. The adventure has begun."*

Compare the opening chord to the closing chord:

```
Em  = Emotion + Connection + Time
      "feeling through relationship across time"
      (the state of being an orphan who doesn't 
       know what he's missing)

Bm  = Time + Action + Unknown
      "time set in motion toward the unknowable"
      (the state of beginning an adventure)
```

**Not a single domain is shared.** Em contains E, G, B. 
Bm contains B, D, F#. They share only **B (Time)** — and 
even that has changed role: in Em, Time is the fifth 
(structural support); in Bm, Time is the root (the 
foundation, the driving force).

The two chords describe two completely different worlds:

| | Em (opening) | Bm (closing) |
|---|---|---|
| **What's present** | Feeling, Connection, Time | Time, Action, Unknown |
| **What it describes** | An orphan's emotional life | An adventurer's departure |
| **What's missing** | Action, the Unknown, Self | Feeling, Connection, Self |
| **Shared** | Time — but repositioned from support to driver |
| **The shift** | From feeling *in* time to time *driving* action |

The entire opening passage is the journey from one world 
to the other. From feeling-connection-time (the child who 
loves and is loved by no one, across the years of lonely 
childhood) to time-action-unknown (the child who steps 
onto a train heading somewhere he cannot imagine).

And notice: **Self (C) is absent from both chords.** 
Neither the orphan's world nor the adventurer's world 
contains the Self as a harmonic element. Harry hasn't 
found himself yet. He won't — not in these opening bars. 
The self appears only in the **C chord** and **Cmaj7** 
in the middle of the passage — briefly, luminously, and 
then it's gone.

The self is a visitor in this music, just as Home was a 
visitor. Both appear for a moment — C in the middle, D# 
in the second phrase — and then vanish.

The theme is the sound of someone who has not yet found 
either home or self. But both have been glimpsed. Both 
have sounded. And both are waiting.

---

## The Complete Chord Journey — v2.0

### Chord 1: Em (Emotion + Connection + Time)

> *"Feeling through relationship across time."*

**Differential:** Spirit became Connection (G# → G). 
The transcendent became the human. This story will be 
about people, not gods.

This chord is the **premise.** It establishes the three 
domains that will govern the entire series: what you feel, 
who you feel it with, and how long you have.

---

### Chord 2: Em sustained

> *"The premise persists. The absence continues."*

The repetition is not redundancy. It is duration. The 
feeling-through-connection-across-time doesn't resolve 
or change. It simply continues. This is the sustained 
reality of the orphan's life: unchanged, persistent, 
waiting.

---

### Chord 3: C (Self + Emotion + Connection)

> *"A being that feels and connects."*

**What entered:** Self (C). For the first time, a person 
is present. Not just feeling and connection and time — 
a SELF.

**What left:** Time (B). The moment the self appears, 
time disappears from the harmony. The self exists outside 
of time — in a single, eternal present. This is the 
moment of recognition: *"I exist."* Not "I existed" or 
"I will exist." Just: *"I am."*

**Common tone analysis:** E (Emotion) and G (Connection) 
persist from Em into C. Feeling and togetherness continue. 
They are the thread. But now they have a self to inhabit.

> *"Feeling and connection persist — and now a self 
> arrives to hold them. A being appears. Timeless for 
> this one moment."*

---

### Chord 4: Cmaj7 (Self + Emotion + Connection + Time)

> *"A being that feels, connects, and exists in time."*

**What entered:** Time (B) returns — as the major 7th, 
the luminous, shimmering note that makes Cmaj7 the most 
open-sounding chord in Western harmony.

**What this means:** The Self that appeared in C now 
acquires Time. Being becomes temporal. Existence becomes 
a story. The self is no longer a timeless moment of 
recognition — it is a self IN time, with a past and a 
future, with the possibility of change.

**Cmaj7 = Self + Emotion + Connection + Time.** Four 
domains. Four elements. The complete human situation.

This chord is not just a word in a sentence. It is the 
**complete description of a conscious life.** It says:

> *"There is a self (C). It feels (E). It belongs (G). 
> It exists in time (B). This is what it means to be 
> alive."*

The celesta plays this chord and a boy steps into his 
own story. Not because he chose to — but because time 
entered his being and being entered time, and from that 
fusion, narrative was born.

Every story begins this way. Not with a conflict or a 
call to adventure or a mentor. With the moment when a 
self acquires time. When "I am" becomes "I was" and 
"I will be." When being becomes biography.

C → Cmaj7: Self acquires Time. The boy becomes a story.

---

### Chord 5: D (Action + Unknown + Knowledge)

> *"Doing that reaches into mystery toward understanding."*

**What entered:** Action (D), Unknown (F#), Knowledge (A). 
THREE entirely new domains, none of which appeared in any 
previous chord.

**What left:** Self (C), Emotion (E), Connection (G). 
Everything personal, emotional, and relational disappears. 
The entire inner world is replaced by the entire outer 
world.

This is the most dramatic chord change in the passage. 
Zero common tones between Cmaj7 (C+E+G+B) and D (D+F#+A). 
Not a single shared note. The two chords inhabit 
completely different harmonic and semantic spaces.

**What this sounds like:** a door opening. A sudden 
change of light. A shift from interior to exterior — 
from the self's inner world to the world of action 
and mystery.

> *"Everything personal vanishes. In its place: doing, 
> mystery, and the possibility of understanding. The 
> quest begins."*

D major is the chord of the quest. Every adventure is 
Action (D) reaching into the Unknown (F#) toward 
Knowledge (A). You do something. You enter unfamiliar 
territory. You learn.

The letter arrives. Hagrid appears. The wall opens. 
D major.

---

### Chord 6: Em (return) — The Premise Restated

> *"Feeling through relationship across time."*

The opening chord returns. But now it carries the weight 
of everything that has sounded between its two appearances.

The first time Em sounded, it was a premise — a state of 
felt absence. Now, having passed through Self (C), Life 
(Cmaj7), and the Quest (D), the same chord means 
something different: it is a **return** to the emotional 
world, enriched by the departure.

**Common tones with D:** none. Em and D share no notes. 
The return from the quest-world (D) to the emotional 
world (Em) has no smooth bridge. It is a leap — a 
sudden reimmersion.

> *"After the quest revealed itself — action, mystery, 
> knowledge — the feeling returns. The same feeling. 
> But the self that feels it has seen something it 
> cannot unsee."*

---

### Chord 7: C#dim (Boundary + Emotion + Connection)

> *"A threshold made of feeling and togetherness."*

The full polyphonic analysis of this chord is above, in 
the melody section. Here is the summary:

**Content:** The three notes (C# + E + G) name three 
domains — a Boundary, Emotion, and Connection. The wall 
between worlds is composed of the very things that allow 
passage through it.

**As a diminished chord:** Maximum instability. Equal 
minor thirds. No resolution available without leaving 
the chord entirely. The threshold cannot sustain itself. 
Something must change.

**The melody note D# (Home) over it:** Home is visible 
from the threshold but not contained in it. It is 
outside. On the other side.

**D# to F (one half step):** Home and the Physical World 
are adjacent. The thinnest wall.

**F to B (tritone):** The physical world and time collide. 
Reality bends.

> *"At a threshold made of feeling and togetherness — 
> unstable, unsustainable — home appears on the other 
> side, one breath from the physical world. And then: 
> reality bends."*

---

### Chord 8: Bm (Time + Action + Unknown)

> *"Time set in motion, heading into the unknowable."*

**Differential:** Home (D#) became Action (D). D# → D. 
The settled became the restless. Belonging became movement.

This is the chord of departure. Of leaving. Of the train 
pulling away from the platform. Home — which appeared for 
one beat as a foreign note over the diminished chord — 
has transformed into Action. The place became a journey. 
The dwelling became a departure.

**Common tones with C#dim:** E is NOT present in Bm 
(Bm = B+D+F#). G is NOT present. The Emotion and 
Connection that composed the threshold are gone. Once 
you cross the boundary, the boundary's materials 
dissolve. You can't go back the same way. The wall 
existed to be crossed, and once crossed, its emotional 
and relational substance disperses.

But **F# (Unknown)** — which first appeared as a foreign 
melodic note over Em, always outside, always reaching — 
is now **inside the chord.** The Unknown has been 
internalized. It is no longer something glimpsed from 
the outside. It is part of the world the character 
inhabits.

> *"The adventure begins. Time drives forward. Action 
> replaces belonging. The unknown — once foreign, once 
> only glimpsed — is now the air you breathe."*

---

## The Complete Journey — One Table

| Chord | Notes | Domains | What Entered | What Left | Translation |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Em** | E+G+B | Emotion+Connection+Time | — | — | "Feeling through relationship across time" |
| **Em** | E+G+B | (same) | — | — | "The feeling persists" |
| **C** | C+E+G | Self+Emotion+Connection | Self (C) | Time (B) | "A being arrives — timeless, feeling, connecting" |
| **Cmaj7** | C+E+G+B | Self+Emotion+Connection+Time | Time (B) | — | "The being acquires time. Life begins." |
| **D** | D+F#+A | Action+Unknown+Knowledge | Action, Unknown, Knowledge | Self, Emotion, Connection | "The inner world vanishes. The quest appears." |
| **Em** | E+G+B | Emotion+Connection+Time | Emotion, Connection, Time | Action, Unknown, Knowledge | "The feeling returns — changed by what it glimpsed" |
| **C#dim** | C#+E+G | Boundary+Emotion+Connection | Boundary (C#) | Time (B) | "A threshold made of feeling and togetherness" |
| **Bm** | B+D+F# | Time+Action+Unknown | Time, Action, Unknown | Boundary, Emotion, Connection | "Time set in motion. The adventure begins." |

### The Arc in One Sentence

Reading only the "What Entered" column:

> *"First there was feeling and connection and time. Then 
> a self arrived. Then time entered the self. Then action, 
> mystery, and knowledge appeared. Then feeling returned, 
> and met a threshold made of itself. Then time began to 
> move, and the unknown became home."*

That is the first eight bars of Hedwig's Theme.

That is the first chapter of Harry Potter.

## What v2.0 Reveals That v1.1 Couldn't

| Observation | v1.1 Reading | v2.0 Reading |
|---|---|---|
| **The key (Em)** | "Emotion, absent" | "Feeling through connection across time — where the spiritual became the human" |
| **C → Cmaj7** | "Self → Self, wondrous" | "The self acquires Time — being becomes biography — the complete human situation in four notes" |
| **D major** | "Action, affirmed" | "Action + Unknown + Knowledge — the quest in three notes — with ZERO common tones with the previous chord (total departure)" |
| **C#dim** | "Boundary, dangerous" | "A threshold made of Emotion and Connection — the wall is composed of the key to the wall" |
| **D# over C#dim** | "Home appears" | "Home appears over a threshold-chord that contains feeling and togetherness — home is on the other side of a wall made of love" |
| **Bm** | "Time, ending" | "Time + Action + Unknown — departure — home has become movement — the unknown has been internalized" |
| **Em vs. Bm** | Both are "X minor" | Share only B (Time), with Time repositioned from support to driver — two completely different worlds |
| **The absence of Self** | Not noted | Self (C) appears only in two chords (C and Cmaj7) and then vanishes — the boy hasn't found himself yet |

The v2.0 analysis is more constrained (each reading is 
determined by specific notes present in specific chords), 
more structurally precise (common tones and absent domains 
are tracked), and reveals patterns that v1.1 could not 
access (the repositioning of Time from support to driver, 
the absence of Self from the endpoints, the zero-common-
tone rupture at D major).

It is also, arguably, a more faithful reading of what a 
chord IS. A chord is not one note with a modifier. It is 
multiple notes, sounding together, creating meaning through 
their combination. v2.0 reads chords the way chords exist: 
as polyphonic, simultaneous, layered.

## The Honest Caveat

Everything in [Chapter 11](11-honest-assessment.md) still 
applies. The root assignments (C = Self, E = Emotion, etc.) 
remain creative choices. The polyphonic readings are 
constrained by the chord's actual notes, but the MEANINGS 
of those notes are assigned, not discovered.

However, v2.0 adds one structural constraint that v1.1 
lacked: **the specific domains present in each chord are 
determined by the notes, not by the analyst.** I cannot 
choose what C#dim "contains" — it contains C#, E, and G, 
and those map to Boundary, Emotion, and Connection. I can 
choose what those labels mean, but I cannot choose which 
labels appear in which chord. The structure constrains the 
reading.

Whether that constraint is sufficient to call this 
"analysis" rather than "creative interpretation" is left 
to the reader.

What I can say is this: when the chord that sounds at the 
moment of maximum magical tension in Hedwig's Theme turns 
out to contain — in its polyphonic reading — Boundary, 
Emotion, and Connection; and when the melody over that 
chord sounds the note for Home; and when Home is one 
half step from the Physical World; and when the interval 
that follows is the most unstable in all of music — 

Something is happening. Whether it is in the music, in 
the language, or in the space between them, something 
is happening.

And it sounds like a wall giving way.
