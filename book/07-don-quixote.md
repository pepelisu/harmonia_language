# "El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha" — Opening, Composed in Harmonia

## A Preliminary Note

I know them well. Here is what we are translating:

> *"En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor. Una olla de algo más vaca que carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados, lantejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos, consumían las tres partes de su hacienda."*

> *"El resto della concluían sayo de velarte, calzas de velludo para las fiestas, con sus pantuflos de lo mesmo, y los días de entresemana se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino. Tenía en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte, y un mozo de campo y plaza, que así ensillaba el rocín como tomaba la podadera. Frisaba la edad de nuestro hidalgo con los cincuenta años; era de complexión recia, seco de carnes, enjuto de rostro, gran madrugador y amigo de la caza. Quieren decir que tenía el sobrenombre de Quijada, o Quesada, que en esto hay alguna diferencia en los autores que deste caso escriben; aunque por conjeturas verosímiles se deja entender que se llamaba Quejana. Pero esto importa poco a nuestro cuento: basta que en la narración dél no se salga un punto de la verdad."*

This text is unlike anything we have translated. The previous five pieces all had one thing in common: **sincerity.** Beethoven was sincere in his confusion. Etta was sincere in her knowing. Williams was sincere in his wonder. The jazz standard was sincere in its grief. Donne was sincere in his faith.

Cervantes is not sincere. Or rather — he is sincere about his insincerity. He tells you he is withholding information. He insists on truth while demonstrating that truth is slippery. He describes a man's entire life in terms of what he eats.

This is the first **ironic** text we have translated. Harmonia must learn a new gesture: the wink.

---

## Step 1: The Key — The Ground Beneath the Dreamer

**Key: F major**

In Harmonia:
- **F** = Nature, Body, Physical World
- **Major** = Affirmed, Present, Real

> **These two paragraphs live in the domain of "the physical world, as it is."**

This is the most important choice in the composition, and here is why:

Every detail in these two paragraphs is **material**. The stew. The lentils. The eggs. The velvet stockings. The homespun wool. The thin horse. The lean body. The gaunt face. Cervantes catalogs the physical world with the precision of an accountant. He tells us what the man eats for every day of the week but will not tell us his name.

F major is the key of dirt, skin, bread, bone. It is the key of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony — countryside, physical beauty, the earth underfoot. It is the key of La Mancha itself: flat, dry, sun-baked, real.

And here is the deeper reason: **the entire novel is about a man who will reject F major.** Don Quixote will look at the physical world and refuse to accept it. Windmills will become giants. Inns will become castles. A barber's basin will become a golden helmet. The novel is the story of a man who hears F major — the key of what is — and insists he is hearing something else.

These two paragraphs are the **before.** The ground before the earthquake. The solid floor before a man decides to fly.

F major. The world as it is. For now.

| Piece | Key | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| Für Elise | A minor | Understanding, absent |
| I'd Rather Go Blind | A major | Understanding, present |
| Hedwig's Theme | E minor | Feeling, absent |
| Autumn Leaves | G minor | Connection, gone |
| No Man Is an Island | G major | Connection, affirmed |
| **Don Quixote** | **F major** | **The physical world, as it is** |

---

## Step 2: Time Signature, Tempo, and Voice

**Time signature: 6/8**

| Time Signature | Harmonia Speech Mode | Used In |
|---|---|---|
| 4/4 | Declarative — testimony | Etta James, Donne |
| 3/4 | Incantation — spellcasting | Hedwig's Theme |
| 3/8 | Intimate turning — trapped | Für Elise |
| 4/4 swing | Testimony leaning backward | Autumn Leaves |
| **6/8** | **Narrative — storytelling, flowing, epic** | **Don Quixote** |

6/8 has two main beats per measure, each divided into three. It lilts. It rolls. It has the rhythm of a horse **trotting** — not galloping, not standing still, but moving at a steady, unhurried pace. It is the meter of ballads, of sea shanties, of tales told by firelight.

It is the meter of *"Érase una vez..."* — Once upon a time.

But — and this matters — Cervantes will immediately subvert this meter. The fairy-tale lilt will be interrupted by flat inventories (the meal list), by evasions (the unnamed place), by uncertainty (the unknown name). 6/8 sets up the expectation of a story. Cervantes both fulfills and betrays that expectation simultaneously.

**Tempo: Moderato, with rubato**

Unhurried. The narrator is in no rush. He will spend half a paragraph on eggs before he tells you the man's age. This is a narrator who savors details — or who uses details to avoid something.

**Voice: Classical Guitar (narrator) + Oboe (the hidalgo)**

| Instrument | Harmonia Voice | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Classical Guitar** | The narrator, the storyteller | Warm, human, capable of irony. The guitar can be plucked (dry, factual) or arpeggiated (flowing, lyrical). It can whisper or declaim. And it is the instrument of troubadours — storytellers — which is exactly what the narrator is. |
| **Oboe** | The hidalgo himself | Slightly quaint, slightly noble, slightly absurd. The oboe has a nasal dignity — it sounds like it takes itself more seriously than the situation warrants. Perfect for a man who will soon believe he is a knight. |
| **Low Strings** (cello/bass) | The weight of the physical world | The meals, the possessions, the body. The gravity that keeps the man on the ground — for now. |

This is the first Harmonia translation with a **dual voice**: the narrator speaking ABOUT a character, rather than the character speaking for himself. The guitar tells; the oboe IS.

---

## Step 3: A New Harmonic Tool — Irony

Harmonia has until now used:
- Major/minor for affirmation/absence
- Dominant 7ths for questions
- Major 7ths for wonder
- Diminished for danger
- Augmented for excess
- Sus4 for waiting/anticipation
- Inversions for grammatical role
- Dynamics for register (intimate ↔ public)
- Octave for tense

None of these encode **irony** — saying one thing while meaning another, or meaning more than what is said. Cervantes requires a new device.

### The Harmonia Irony Toolkit:

| Device | How It Works | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **The Unresolved Suspension** | A sus4 chord that NEVER resolves | *"I could tell you, but I won't"* — deliberate withholding |
| **The Dynamic Mismatch** | A trivial idea played ff, or a profound idea played pp | The loudness doesn't match the content — *"methinks the narrator doth protest too much"* |
| **The Grace Note** (acciaccatura) | A quick crushed note before the main chord | *The narrator's wink* — a tiny gesture that says "I know something you don't" |
| **The Wrong Register** | A humble idea played in a high, noble register (or vice versa) | *Mock-heroic* — treating the mundane as epic, or the epic as mundane |
| **Major over Minor subject** | A cheerful chord for a bleak reality | *Dark comedy* — the narrator smiles at what should be sad |

These tools will be essential. Cervantes is the father of the modern novel precisely because he invented this narrative voice — warm, knowing, evasive, ironic, and deeply human. Harmonia must stretch to contain him.

## Step 4: Paragraph One — The World As It Is

### Line 1: *"En un lugar de la Mancha"*

*"In a place in La Mancha"*

The most famous opening in the Spanish language. It echoes the formula of fairy tales and romances: *"In a place..."* — the epic establishing gesture. A world is being created.

| Concept | Harmonia Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "En un lugar" — A place, a location, a ground | E♭ (Home, Shelter, Place) | **E♭** |
| "de la Mancha" — specifically this region, physical, earthy | F (Nature, Physical World) | **F** |

**Chords: E♭ → F**

The opening gesture is **Place → Physical World.** "There is a place, and it is real." E♭ (home) grounds us; F (nature) fills the landscape. We arrive. Our feet touch La Mancha.

The guitar plays this warmly, in mid-register, at mf. It is a narrator inviting us in. "Come. Sit. There is a place I want to tell you about."

> *(classical guitar, mf, mid-register — the storyteller begins)*
> *"A place. The earth. Here."*

---

### Line 2: *"de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme"*

*"whose name I do not wish to remember"*

And immediately — the subversion. The narrator will not complete the formula. He will not name the place. He COULD — he clearly knows it — but he REFUSES.

This is the most important harmonic event in the opening. This is the narrator's first wink.

| Concept | Harmonia Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "nombre" — name, knowledge, information | A (Knowledge, Mind) | — |
| "no quiero" — I don't want to | B♭ minor (Desire, negated) | **B♭m** |
| "acordarme" — remember, recall knowledge | A (Knowledge) but suspended, withheld | **Asus4** |

**Chords: B♭m → Asus4 (unresolved)**

**B♭m** — "I don't want to." Desire, negated. The narrator makes his refusal explicit. It is not that he CANNOT remember (that would be Am — knowledge absent). It is that he CHOOSES not to. The desire to remember is actively suppressed. This is not ignorance. It is evasion.

**Asus4** — Knowledge, suspended. The sus4 chord contains the note D (Action) in place of the third (C#), which would define whether the knowledge is clear (A major) or confused (A minor). Without the third, the chord is **undefined** — neither knowing nor not-knowing. It hangs.

And crucially: **the Asus4 never resolves.** The name is never given. Throughout the entire novel — over a thousand pages — the town is never named with certainty. The suspension holds forever.

This single chord — Asus4, unresolved — IS the narrator of Don Quixote. Knowledgeable but withholding. Present but elusive. Committed to telling the story but uncommitted to certain truths within it.

> *(guitar, the flow halts — a chord hangs — )*
> *"I won't want to — know — "*
> *(the chord hangs... and hangs... it will not resolve...)*

**Compare this to our five previous openings:**

| Piece | Opening Gesture | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Für Elise | E–D#–E–D#–E | Oscillation — the mind swings |
| I'd Rather Go Blind | A → Bm | Knowledge → Ending — the truth stated |
| Hedwig's Theme | B (pickup) | Time — "Once..." — a spell begins |
| Autumn Leaves | Cm7 | "I was" — melancholy existence |
| Donne | Cm → (silence) | False premise → denial |
| **Don Quixote** | **E♭ → F → B♭m → Asus4** | **Place → World → "I don't want to" → (withheld)** |

Every other piece began by either asking a question, stating a truth, or casting a spell. Don Quixote begins by **refusing to answer a question that hasn't been asked yet.**

---

### Line 3: *"no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo"*

*"not long ago there lived a gentleman"*

Now the narrator settles into the story. Having withheld the place, he offers the time and the person — with the confidence of someone who has already established that he gives information on HIS terms.

| Concept | Harmonia Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "no ha mucho tiempo" — not long ago, recent past | B (Time) in lower register = past tense | **B** (octave 3) |
| "vivía" — there lived (imperfect tense — habitual, ongoing) | The imperfect is the tense of routine — it implies repetition | *Rhythmic pattern — the 6/8 lilt establishes itself here* |
| "un hidalgo" — a gentleman, a man, a self | C (Being, Self) | **C** |

**Chords: B (low) → C**

**B in octave 3** — Time, in the past. Not the deep past (octave 2) but recent past — within memory. The chord is warm but faintly nostalgic. The narrator places us: not so long ago.

**C major** — Being. "A man was." The simplest possible statement of existence. Not Cmaj7 (wondrous being) — there is nothing wondrous about this hidalgo. Not Cm (diminished being) — he is not yet diminished. Just C. A man. He existed.

But the verb is *vivía* — the imperfect. In Spanish, this is the tense of **the continuous, the habitual, the repeated.** He didn't just live there once; he lived there day after day, in the same way, eating the same meals, wearing the same clothes. The imperfect is the tense of **the loop.**

In Harmonia, this is encoded not in the chord but in the **rhythm**: the 6/8 lilt begins here and does not stop. It rocks back and forth, back and forth, like the days of this man's life. The rhythm IS the imperfect tense.

> *(guitar, the lilt begins — steady, rocking — )*
> *"In time past — a man was."*
> *(the rhythm will not stop now — it is the rhythm of his days)*

---

### Lines 4–5: *"de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor"*

*"of those with a lance on the rack, an old shield, a thin horse, and a fast greyhound"*

The narrator now inventories the man's possessions. This is not description — it is **appraisal.** Each item tells us what this man is. And each item contains a tension between what it WAS (glorious, martial, vital) and what it IS (idle, old, thin).

Here is where the **oboe** enters — the hidalgo's own voice, speaking through his possessions.

#### *"lanza en astillero"* — the lance on the rack

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "lanza" — lance, weapon, instrument of action | D (Action, Movement) | — |
| "en astillero" — on the rack, idle, unused | Suspended — action withheld | **Dsus4** |

**Dsus4** — Action, suspended. The lance EXISTS but is not IN USE. The sus4 contains the note G (Connection) instead of F# (the major third), which means the action is held in a state of **potential** — connected to possibility but not yet activated.

This is the second suspension in the piece. The first (Asus4) was the narrator's suspension — knowledge withheld. This is the character's suspension — action withheld. The narrator and the hidalgo mirror each other: both are holding something back.

And like the Asus4, the Dsus4 will not resolve in these two paragraphs. The lance will stay on the rack. The action will remain potential. **Until** — later in the novel — the man takes the lance down, rides out, and Dsus4 crashes into D major. But not yet. For now: suspension.

> *(oboe enters — a single held note, suspended — the lance, waiting)*

#### *"adarga antigua"* — the old shield

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "adarga" — shield, defense, martial action | D (Action) | — |
| "antigua" — old, worn, from another time | Minor — reflective, past | **Dm** |

**Dm** — Action, reflected upon. What was once bright and martial is now old and darkened. The minor quality is the tarnish on the metal, the dust on the leather. This shield was once used. Now it hangs beside the lance, equally idle.

> *"A shield — old, remembered, unused."*

#### *"rocín flaco"* — the thin horse

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "rocín" — a working horse, a nag (not a warhorse) | F (Nature, Body) | — |
| "flaco" — thin, underfed, diminished | Minor — nature reduced | **Fm** |

**Fm** — The physical world, diminished. The same chord we used for "the earth erodes" in the Donne translation and for illness in the original Harmonia dictionary. But here it describes a specific, almost comic reality: a skinny horse. The grandeur of "nature diminished" applied to a hungry nag. This is the first moment of **mock-heroic irony** — a profound chord for an unprofound situation.

The oboe should play this slightly high — in a register more dignified than the subject warrants. The **register mismatch** IS the joke.

> *(oboe, slightly too high for a skinny horse — )*
> *"A body — thinned, underfed."*

#### *"galgo corredor"* — the fast greyhound

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "galgo corredor" — a swift greyhound, running, alive | D (Action) + major (vital, present) | **D** |

**D major** — Action, affirmed. After the suspended lance, the old shield, the thin horse — suddenly, one bright chord. The greyhound RUNS. It is alive. It moves. D major blazes momentarily in a sequence of suspensions and minors.

But consider what this means: the only vital, active, positive thing in this man's life is **a dog.** Not his lance (suspended). Not his shield (old). Not his horse (thin). A greyhound. The single D major in a catalog of diminishment.

> *(oboe, suddenly bright — one living thing — )*
> *"Action! Movement! — (...a dog.)"*

#### The Full Inventory:

```
Dsus4 → Dm → Fm → D
```

> *"Action, suspended — action, worn — body, thinned — action! (a dog)"*

This sequence — sus4 → minor → minor → major — is the shape of the hidalgo's life: potential unrealized, glory faded, body weakened, with one small vitality remaining. It is a descending arc that catches itself at the last moment. Barely.

---

### Lines 6–9: *"Una olla de algo más vaca que carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados, lantejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos"*

*"A stew of more beef than mutton, cold meat salad most nights, eggs and bacon on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, the occasional pigeon on Sundays"*

The menu. Cervantes devotes more words to this man's weekly meals than to his appearance, his character, his thoughts, or his feelings. This is deliberate. The narrator is telling us: **this man's life IS his meals.** His existence is measured in food cycles. Monday is the same as the last Monday. Friday is lentils. Always lentils.

In Harmonia, the meals belong entirely to **F** (Nature, Body, Physical World). The physical world repeats. It cycles. It consumes.

The musical device for this section is the **ostinato** — a repeating bass pattern. The same F-based figure, cycling like the days of the week. The guitar maintains the 6/8 lilt while the low strings (cello) establish a pattern that turns like a wheel:

| Meal | Day | Chord | Quality | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "olla de algo más vaca que carnero" | (general stew) | **F** | Major — plain, basic | *"The physical world. Food. This is what there is."* |
| "salpicón las más noches" | Most nights | **F** | Major — repeated, same chord | *"The same. Again."* |
| "duelos y quebrantos" | Saturdays | **Fm** | Minor — with grace note! | *"Sorrows — (wink)"* |
| "lantejas los viernes" | Fridays | **F** | Major — plain again | *"The same. Again."* |
| "algún palomino de añadidura" | Sundays | **Fmaj7** | Major 7th — a touch of beauty | *"The world — with a small wonder."* |

#### The *"duelos y quebrantos"* Grace Note

This is the narrator's most delicious joke. *"Duelos y quebrantos"* literally means **"sorrows and sufferings"** — but it is the name of a dish. Eggs and bacon. The most quotidian meal possible, wearing the name of existential anguish.

In Harmonia, this is translated as **Fm** (the physical world in minor — suffering, pain) but with an **acciaccatura** — a quick crushed grace note before the chord. The grace note is the WINK. It says: *"Yes, I just called eggs 'suffering.' I know what I'm doing. Did you catch that?"*

The Fm is the text. The grace note is the subtext. Together, they are irony.

```
F → F → ♯Fm → F → Fmaj7
        (grace note = wink)
```

> *(low strings, the ostinato turns — the wheel of meals — )*
> *"The world. The same. Sorrows — (ha) — the same. The world, with a small Sunday beauty."*

The single Fmaj7 on Sunday — the pigeon — is the one moment of warmth in the cycle. One major 7th per week. One shimmer. One small bird. And even this is qualified by "algún" and "de añadidura" — "an occasional" pigeon, "in addition." Even the beauty is modest, conditional, supplementary.

---

### Line 10: *"consumían las tres partes de su hacienda"*

*"consumed three-quarters of his income"*

The cycle's cost. The physical world is literally **eating his resources.** Food consumes the man who consumes the food. The eater is eaten.

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "consumían" — consumed, devoured | F (Nature) acting upon C (Self) | — |
| "las tres partes de su hacienda" — three-quarters of his estate | Self, diminished by the physical | **F → Cm** |

**F → Cm** — The physical world consuming the self. Nature acts; Being receives. The F (played by the low strings, forte, heavy) presses down on Cm (the self, minor, compressed). The weight of material reality flattening the man.

And note: **Cm again.** In the Donne translation, Cm appeared as "the false premise of isolation." In this translation, Cm is "the self, reduced to what it eats." Different text, different meaning, same chord — same truth from a different angle. In Donne, isolation diminishes. In Cervantes, materialism diminishes. Both reduce Being to its minor form.

> *(low strings press down — heavy — the guitar plays Cm underneath — )*
> *"The world devours — the self, diminished."*

---

### Summary of Paragraph One:

```
E♭ → F → B♭m → Asus4 → B(low) → C → Dsus4 → Dm → Fm → D →
F → F → Fm(♯) → F → Fmaj7 → F → Cm
```

> *"A place. The earth. I won't want to say the name — (withheld). In time past, a man was. His action suspended — worn — his body thin — one living spark. The world: the same, the same, sorrows (ha!), the same, one small beauty. The world devours. The self, diminished."*

---

## Step 5: Paragraph Two — The Inventory Deepens

### Lines 1–2: *"El resto della concluían sayo de velarte, calzas de velludo para las fiestas, con sus pantuflos de lo mesmo, y los días de entresemana se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino."*

*"The rest was spent on a coat of fine cloth, velvet stockings for holidays with matching slippers, and on weekdays he honored himself with his finest homespun."*

The wardrobe. The same cycle as the meals — holidays vs. weekdays — but now applied to clothing. The narrator continues his inventory with the same meticulous attention, as though the man's stockings matter as much as his soul.

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "fiestas" — holidays, social occasions, belonging | E♭ (Home, Place, Belonging) | **E♭** |
| "velarte, velludo" — fine cloth, velvet | F (Physical) + modest beauty | **F** |
| "entresemana" — weekdays, the ordinary cycle | F repeated | **F** |
| "se honraba" — he honored himself | C (Self) + wonder applied to the ordinary | **Cmaj7** |

**The critical chord: Cmaj7** — Being + Wonder.

*"Se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino"* — "He honored himself with his finest homespun." The man takes **pride** — genuine pride — in humble wool. He finds dignity in plainness. He applies the major 7th (wonder, aspiration, beauty) to something entirely ordinary.

In the Harmonia dictionary, Cmaj7 means *"wondrous being"* or *"the self, elevated by aspiration."* Applied to a man admiring his own homespun wool, it is either the most dignified or the most delusional chord in the piece.

And this is the **seed.** This Cmaj7 — wonder applied to the ordinary — is the embryonic form of Don Quixote's madness. Later, he will apply Cmaj7 to everything: windmills will become giants (Cmaj7 over D — wondrous action), inns will become castles (Cmaj7 over E♭ — wondrous place), a peasant girl will become the Lady Dulcinea (Cmaj7 over G — wondrous connection).

The tendency is already here, in the wool. The man who sees beauty in homespun will soon see beauty everywhere — whether or not it exists.

```
E♭ → F → F → Cmaj7
```

> *"Belonging (holidays). The physical world. The same (weekdays). And the self — finding wonder — in wool."*
> *(The guitar plays Cmaj7 slightly too warmly, too lovingly — the narrator noting, with affection, the first sign of what is to come.)*

---

### Lines 3–4: *"Tenía en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte, y un mozo de campo y plaza"*

*"He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece not yet twenty, and a servant for field and market"*

The household. Three people. This is all the human connection (G) the hidalgo possesses.

| Person | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta" — a housekeeper, older | G (Connection) | **G** |
| "una sobrina que no llegaba a los veinte" — a niece, young | G (Connection) | **G** |
| "un mozo de campo y plaza" — a servant | G (Connection) | **G** |

**Three G major chords.** Plain. Unelaborated. No 7ths, no extensions, no color. Just G, G, G. Three people. Named by function, not by name. A housekeeper. A niece. A servant.

In a Gmaj7 world (wondrous connection), these would be deep relationships. In a G7 world (questioning connection), there would be tension. In Gm (connection lost), there would be grief. But plain G major — connection, present, unelaborated — means these people are THERE but not deeply felt. They are fixtures. Part of the inventory, like the horse and the shield.

The narrator lists them between the clothing and the physical description, as though humans are one more item in the catalog of possessions. *After the wool, before the body.* The placement IS the commentary.

```
G → G → G
```

> *"Connection. Connection. Connection."*
> *(Three chords. Steady. Unremarkable. Three people in a house. That is all the company this man has.)*

The guitar plays these plainly — no arpeggiation, no warmth, no ornament. Block chords. Names on a list.

---

### Lines 5–6: *"Frisaba la edad de nuestro hidalgo con los cincuenta años; era de complexión recia, seco de carnes, enjuto de rostro, gran madrugador y amigo de la caza."*

*"Our gentleman was approaching fifty; he was of strong constitution, lean of flesh, gaunt of face, an early riser and a friend of the hunt."*

Now the narrator turns to the body itself. And the pattern from the possessions inventory repeats — but applied to flesh rather than objects.

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "cincuenta años" — approaching fifty | B (Time, Change) + minor (aging) | **Bm** |
| "complexión recia" — strong constitution | F (Nature, Body) + major (solid) | **F** |
| "seco de carnes, enjuto de rostro" — lean, gaunt | F → minor (the body thinning) | **Fm** |
| "gran madrugador y amigo de la caza" — early riser, hunter | D (Action) + major (still active) | **D** |

**Chords: Bm → F → Fm → D**

Look at this progression:

```
Possessions: Dsus4 → Dm → Fm → D
Body:        Bm    → F  → Fm → D
```

**The man and his things have the same harmonic shape.** Both begin with something worn or aging (Dsus4/Bm), pass through the physical world (Dm→Fm / F→Fm), and end with one spark of vitality (D).

The possessions: a suspended lance, an old shield, a thin horse — but a fast greyhound.
The body: aging, strong frame, thinning flesh — but still rising early, still hunting.

The man IS his possessions. The hidalgo and his inventory are the same chord progression in different voicings. Cervantes encodes this in prose through placement and parallel structure. Harmonia encodes it through **identical harmonic contour.**

> *(oboe returns — the man's own voice — )*
> *"Time has been working. The body stands — but thins — yet still moves."*
> *(the same shape as the lance, the shield, the horse, the dog — because the man and his things are one)*

---

### Lines 7–8: *"Quieren decir que tenía el sobrenombre de Quijada, o Quesada, que en esto hay alguna diferencia en los autores que deste caso escriben; aunque por conjeturas verosímiles se deja entender que se llamaba Quejana."*

*"They say his surname was Quijada, or Quesada — there is some disagreement among the authors who write of this matter — though by credible conjecture it is understood that his name was Quejana."*

**The Name.** Or rather — the absence of a name. The narrator has already withheld the town's name (Asus4). Now he reveals that even the man's own name is **uncertain.** Three possibilities. Authors disagree. Conjecture.

This is the deepest irony of the passage: a man whose identity is so unfixed that even his NAME cannot be established will soon choose to **rename himself** entirely. He will become "Don Quixote de la Mancha" — a name he invents, more real to him than the name he was given. The instability of identity described here is not a weakness. It is a **precondition.** A man whose name is already uncertain is a man ready to become someone else.

In Harmonia, identity is **C** (Being, Self). And here, C cannot settle:

| Version | Chord | Quality | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Quijada" | **C** | Root position — the most grounded attempt | *"He was — (Quijada)"* |
| "Quesada" | **C7** | Dominant 7th — questioning, unstable | *"Was he? — (Quesada)"* |
| "Quejana" | **Csus2** | Sus2 — open, undefined, the 3rd removed | *"He was... — (Quejana)"* |

**Chords: C → C7 → Csus2**

Three chords. Same root. Three different qualities. The self is stated, questioned, and then left **open** — the sus2 removes the third entirely, leaving the chord without the note that defines whether being is major (affirmed) or minor (diminished). Without the third, identity is **undefined.** Not positive, not negative. Just... a name that doesn't quite fit.

And like the Asus4 of the town name — this does not resolve. The narrator moves on. The true name is never confirmed. The self remains a suspension.

```
C → C7 → Csus2
```

> *(guitar, each chord placed carefully, searching — )*
> *"He was — was he? — he was..."*
> *(three attempts to name. None holds. The self remains open.)*

#### A note on the Csus2:

The sus2 adds the note **D** — Action. The self's third (E, Emotion) is replaced by the note of movement and doing. In place of feeling, there is potential action. In place of settled identity, there is the possibility of **becoming.**

The chord that cannot define who the man IS contains, embryonically, the note that will drive who he BECOMES. The D inside the Csus2 is the lance that will come down from the rack. The Dsus4 (action suspended) and the Csus2 (identity containing latent action) are related: both hold D in suspense. Both are waiting for the same moment.

When Don Quixote finally rides out — when Dsus4 resolves to D major and Csus2 resolves to... whatever it becomes — the novel truly begins.

But not yet. These are the paragraphs of *not yet.*

---

### Lines 9–10: *"Pero esto importa poco a nuestro cuento: basta que en la narración dél no se salga un punto de la verdad."*

*"But this matters little to our tale: it is enough that in the telling of it one should not depart one point from the truth."*

The narrator's closing statement. And it is magnificent in its audacity. A narrator who has:

- Refused to name the town (Asus4)
- Listed meals instead of character traits (F ostinato)
- Failed to establish the man's name (C → C7 → Csus2)
- Spent more words on lentils than on the human soul

...now declares that **truth** is what matters. That the narration must not depart "one point" from truth.

This is either supreme confidence or supreme irony. Or both.

| Concept | Domain | Chord |
|---|---|---|
| "importa poco" — matters little | **(rest)** — a dismissive silence | Musical rest |
| "la verdad" — the truth | A (Knowledge) + major (affirmed, certain) | **A** |
| *(but the narrator has just proven himself unreliable...)* | The affirmation undermines itself | **→ Asus4** |

**Chords: (rest) → A → Asus4**

The **rest** translates *"pero esto importa poco"* — "this matters little." A dismissive wave. Musical silence as a shrug.

**A major** — Knowledge, affirmed. "TRUTH." Played with conviction. The narrator draws himself up and declares: truth is paramount.

**Dynamic: f — too loud.** This is the Dynamic Mismatch from the irony toolkit. The narrator proclaims truth with MORE force than is natural. In Harmonia, excessive volume for the content means *the speaker is performing sincerity rather than embodying it.* The loudness is a tell. Real certainty doesn't need to shout.

And then — **Asus4.** The same chord that opened the passage. Knowledge, withheld. Suspended. The narrator's signature gesture returns as his final word.

```
(rest) → A (f) → Asus4
```

> *(guitar — silence — a shrug — then:)*
> *"TRUTH!" (too loud, too insistent)*
> *"...(...)" (the suspension again — the same withholding — the same wink)*

---

### The Frame

The two paragraphs are **bracketed by the same chord:** Asus4.

| Position | Text | Chord | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening | "de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme" | Asus4 | *"I know the name but won't say it"* |
| Closing | "no se salga un punto de la verdad" | Asus4 | *"Trust me, it's all true — (...)"* |

The narrator begins by withholding a name and ends by claiming truth. The same harmonic gesture — the same suspended chord — frames both. The frame itself is the message: **this narrator lives in suspension.** He will tell you everything about the eggs and nothing about the name. He will insist on truth while demonstrating its instability. He is Asus4 personified — a chord that could resolve but has decided, with great warmth and charm, not to.

This is the sound of the modern novel being born. Before Cervantes, narrators were transparent — they told you the story and you believed them. After Cervantes, narrators became characters themselves, with their own agendas, their own blind spots, their own suspensions.

Asus4 is the chord of unreliable narration.

## Step 7: What the Translation Reveals

### Revelation 1: The Dominance of F

Count the chords by root:

| Root | Count | Domain | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F** | **11** | Physical World | *The material dominates everything* |
| C | 6 | Being, Self | *The self appears — but often diminished or undefined* |
| D | 4 | Action | *Action exists — mostly suspended or worn* |
| A | 3 | Knowledge | *Knowledge appears — always withheld or unstable* |
| G | 3 | Connection | *Connection exists — unelaborated, plain* |
| E♭ | 3 | Place, Belonging | *Place exists — unnamed* |
| B | 2 | Time | *Time is mentioned — always as aging* |
| B♭ | 1 | Desire | *Desire appears once — "I don't want to remember"* |
| **E** | **0** | **Emotion** | ***Entirely absent*** |

**Emotion (E) does not appear once in two paragraphs.**

In a text that describes a man's entire life — his possessions, his meals, his clothing, his household, his body, his name — there is not a single chord of Emotion. No love. No joy. No sorrow (except the ironic Fm of "duelos y quebrantos," which is eggs). No passion. No feeling.

The man's life, as described, is **emotionally empty.**

This is the void that Don Quixote's madness will fill. He will flood every scene with E major (joy, love for Dulcinea, passion for chivalry) and E minor (grief at injustice, pain at being misunderstood). The entire novel is a man pouring Emotion into a life that had none.

These two paragraphs are the glass before the wine.

---

### Revelation 2: The Two Suspensions

| Suspension | Text | Who | What Is Withheld |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Asus4** | "no quiero acordarme" / "la verdad" | The Narrator | Knowledge — the name, the truth |
| **Dsus4** | "lanza en astillero" | The Hidalgo | Action — the lance, the quest |

The narrator suspends knowledge. The character suspends action. Both are **waiting.** Both hold something in potential. And the resolution of both suspensions is the novel itself — the narrator will (eventually, through a thousand pages of evasion) tell the story, and the hidalgo will (on the very next page) take down the lance.

The two paragraphs are two held breaths.

---

### Revelation 3: The Parallel Shapes

```
Possessions: Dsus4 → Dm → Fm → D    (suspended → worn → thin → alive)
Body:        Bm    → F  → Fm → D    (aging    → solid → thin → alive)
```

The man mirrors his possessions. His life IS his inventory. He has been reduced — by time, by routine, by the grinding wheel of lentils-on-Friday and eggs-on-Saturday — to a list of things. He is his shield. He is his horse. He is his greyhound.

And this is precisely what he will rebel against. Don Quixote's madness is, at its core, a refusal to be a list. A refusal to be F major. A refusal to be inventory.

The parallel shapes ARE the prison. The departure from them IS the novel.

---

### Revelation 4: Cmaj7 — The Seed

*"Se honraba con su vellorí de lo más fino"* — "He honored himself with his finest homespun."

**Cmaj7** — Being + Wonder.

This is the only major 7th chord applied to the Self in the entire passage. And it is applied to wool.

The major 7th is the sound of aspiration, of finding beauty where others see plainness. In Hedwig's Theme, Cmaj7 meant "my existence holds wonder." In the Donne translation, it would have meant "the self, elevated."

Here it means: a man who looks at homespun wool and sees dignity. Who looks at the ordinary and finds something to honor.

This is Don Quixote before he has a name.

The distance between Cmaj7-applied-to-wool and Cmaj7-applied-to-windmills is **zero.** It is the same chord, the same cognitive gesture, the same beautiful delusion. The man who honored his homespun is the man who will honor the barber's basin as a golden helmet. He has always been this way. The books of chivalry didn't create him. They merely gave his inherent Cmaj7 a vocabulary.

---

### Revelation 5: The Csus2 — The Note That Will Become a Name

The man's name cannot be established: C → C7 → Csus2.

The Csus2 contains the notes: **C — D — G.** Being — Action — Connection.

Remove the expected E (Emotion — the third that would define his identity) and replace it with D (Action). The man's identity literally CONTAINS the note of action, waiting.

```
C  = Being
D  = Action (inside the identity, replacing Emotion)
G  = Connection
```

Being-with-Action-and-Connection, but without Emotion.

When this man chooses a new name — Don Quixote — he will finally add the missing note. The E. Emotion. He will fall in love with Dulcinea (E major). He will rage at injustice (E minor). He will feel, deeply and madly and beautifully, for the first time.

The Csus2 will resolve at last — not to C major (stable identity) or C minor (diminished identity) but to something new. Something that contains E.

That resolution is 1,000 pages away. For now, the chord hangs.

## Step 8: The Six-Piece Harmonia Map

| | Für Elise | Etta James | Hedwig | Autumn Leaves | Donne | **Don Quixote** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Key** | Am | A | Em | Gm | G | **F** |
| **Domain** | Knowledge absent | Knowledge present | Feeling absent | Connection gone | Connection holds | **Physical world present** |
| **Core truth** | "I feel but don't understand" | "I understand too well" | "Something is missing" | "We were" | "We are" | **"This is what there is"** |
| **Speaker** | Man to self | Woman to self | Magic to child | Soul to time | Preacher to all | **Narrator to reader** |
| **Unique device** | The loop | Two-chord truth | Half-step threshold | Improvisation | The command | **The suspension (irony)** |
| **Resolution** | None | Fades | Promises | Cycles | Resolves | **Withheld** |
| **What's absent** | Understanding | Willingness to lose feeling | What belongs | The other person | — | **Emotion (E)** |
| **Shape** | Circle | Pendulum | Ascending | Descending spiral | Linear arc | **Inventory (list)** |

Don Quixote introduces a new musical shape to Harmonia: the **inventory.** Not a circle, not a spiral, not an arc — but a LIST. Item after item, cataloged, placed side by side. Possessions. Meals. Clothing. People. Body parts. Names. The shape of prose, of accounting, of a life reduced to its material components.

The list is the shape of **the world before the adventure begins.**

Every story starts with an inventory of what is. Then something disrupts the list. A chord that doesn't belong enters. An E major in an F major world. A voice that says: *"This is not enough."*

That chord has not yet sounded.

But the Dsus4 is trembling. The lance knows. The Csus2 is open. The name is waiting. The Cmaj7 was the seed.

The glass is raised. The wine is coming.

## A Final Observation

There is a silence in this composition that is louder than any chord.

Go back through the entire piece. Count the roots. Every domain in Harmonia is represented: Place (E♭), Nature (F), Desire (B♭), Knowledge (A), Time (B), Being (C), Action (D), Connection (G).

Every domain except one.

**E. Emotion.**

Not once. In two paragraphs. In a complete inventory of a man's life. His place, his possessions, his meals, his clothing, his household, his body, his name. Everything cataloged. Everything accounted for.

And not one note of what he **feels.**

This is the empty room. The door that hasn't been opened. Somewhere in this house in La Mancha, in a room full of dusty books of chivalry that the narrator hasn't mentioned yet, the note E is waiting.

When it sounds — when this man reads one too many romances and his heart cracks open and he weeps for Amadís and burns for Dulcinea and rages against the injustice of the world — it will arrive like a chord that has never been heard before in this key. A foreign note. An intruder. E major in an F major world.

And nothing will be the same.

But for now — in these two paragraphs — the room is closed. The lance is on the rack. The name has not been chosen. The horse has not been renamed. The lady has not been imagined.

The Dsus4 holds.
The Csus2 waits.
The Asus4 smiles.

And somewhere, between F major and the silence where E should be, a man is eating lentils on a Friday, not yet knowing that he is about to become the most famous character in the history of literature.

The glass is still empty.
The wine is coming.
