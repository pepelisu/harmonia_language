# "I'd Rather Go Blind" — Translated into Harmonia

## Step 1: The Key Signature — The Domain of the Conversation

**Key: A major (with blues inflections)**

In Harmonia:
- **A** = Mind, Knowledge, Understanding
- **Major** = Positive, Affirmative

> **The entire song lives in the domain of "Knowing."**

But here is the first profound detail — this is a song about someone who **knows** something painful is true, who **sees** what is happening, and who would rather lose sight itself than carry that knowledge.

The key of A major doesn't mean the song is happy. It means the speaker **has clarity**. She *understands*. That's what makes it devastating.

**Harmonia context sentence:**
> *"I am speaking from a place of knowing."*

---

## Step 2: Tempo, Dynamics, and Register

Before touching a single chord, the *way* the music is delivered carries grammatical meaning:

| Musical Element | What We Hear | Harmonia Grammar |
|---|---|---|
| **Tempo: Very slow** | Deliberate, unhurried | Each word is *chosen carefully* — this is testimony, not conversation |
| **Dynamics: mp, building to f** | Starts controlled, grows raw | Moves from private reflection → public declaration |
| **Register: Mid-range (octave 3–4)** | Grounded, present | **Present tense** — this is happening *now* |
| **Vocal texture: Rough, breaking** | Pain in the instrument itself | The *voice* is already a word — it says "wounded" |
| **Rhythm: Behind the beat** | Dragging, reluctant | The speaker does not *want* to say what she is saying |

> **Grammar frame:** Present tense. Starting as intimate confession, rising to a declaration. Every phrase is reluctant — the rhythm itself resists moving forward.

---

## Step 3: The Chord Foundation — The Core Vocabulary

This is where "I'd Rather Go Blind" reveals its genius — and its perfect Harmonia translation.

The entire song is built on essentially **two chords**:

```
A  ——→  Bm  ——→  A  ——→  Bm  ——→  (repeating)
```

With occasional **E** or **E7** at transition points.

Let me translate each:

| Chord | Root | Quality | Harmonia Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| **A Major** | Knowledge, Mind | Positive (clear) | *"I know. I see. I understand."* |
| **B minor** | Time, Change | Negative (loss) | *"It is ending. Time is taking this away."* |
| **E Major** | Emotion, Feeling | Positive | *"Love. What I feel."* |
| **E7** | Emotion | Dominant 7th (question) | *"What is this feeling? Why do I still feel?"* |

### The Core Oscillation

The entire song swings between just two ideas:

```
A  ———→  Bm  ———→  A  ———→  Bm
"I know"  "it ends"  "I know"  "it ends"
"I know"  "it ends"  "I know"  "it ends"
```

Over and over and over.

> **This is not a conversation. This is a pendulum.**
> Knowing ↔ Ending. Knowing ↔ Ending.
> She cannot escape either truth.

Compare this to Für Elise's oscillation (Am ↔ E = "not-knowing ↔ feeling"). Beethoven swings between **confusion and emotion**. Etta swings between **clarity and loss**. Beethoven's pain is that he *doesn't understand*. Etta's pain is that she *does*.

---

## Step 4: The Melody — The Thread of Meaning

Over those two chords, Etta's vocal melody emphasizes specific notes. Let's translate the most prominent ones:

| Melody Note | Harmonia Domain | Function in the Song |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Knowledge | The home note — always returning to "I know" |
| **E** | Emotion, Feeling | The reaching note — "what I feel" |
| **C#** | *(enharmonic D♭)* Conflict, Boundary | The tension note — "the line I cannot cross" |
| **B** | Time, Change | "Time passing" — the note that pulls away |
| **D** | Action, Movement | "Going" — the word she fears most |

### The Melodic Sentence

When Etta sings the main vocal phrases, her melody traces this path:

```
E → C# → B → A
```

In Harmonia:

> ***"Feeling... tension... time passing... I know."***

Or more naturally:

> ***"What I feel meets what I cannot bear, and as time moves, I understand."***

She always **descends** back to A — back to knowing. The melody keeps trying to rise (toward emotion, toward feeling) and keeps falling back down to **the truth she already holds**.

---

## Step 5: Section-by-Section Translation

### The Intro (Instrumental)

*Slow, mid-register, quiet — just the band breathing*

```
A ——— Bm ——— A ——— Bm
```

| Chord | Translation |
|-------|-------------|
| A | *"I know..."* |
| Bm | *"...it is ending..."* |
| A | *"...I know..."* |
| Bm | *"...it is ending."* |

> Before a single word is sung, the instruments already speak:
> ***"I know it is ending. I know it is ending."***

The piano and bass state the fact. The testimony begins before the witness opens her mouth.

---

### Verse 1 — "Something told me..."

*Dynamics: mp — controlled, intimate, private*
*Register: mid (octave 4) — present tense*
*Rhythm: behind the beat — reluctant*

**Chords:**
```
A  →  Bm  →  A  →  Bm
A  →  Bm  →  A  →  Bm
```

**Melody notes traced:** E → C# → B → A (repeating descent)

**Harmonia translation, step by step:**

| Element | Musical Event | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| Chord | A Major | *"I know"* |
| Melody | E descending to C# | *"My feeling met a boundary"* |
| Chord change | → Bm | *"And time began to end it"* |
| Melody | B falling to A | *"Change returned me to knowing"* |
| Dynamic | mp, restrained | *(spoken privately, to oneself)* |
| Rhythm | Behind beat | *(reluctantly)* |

**Verse 1 in Harmonia reads:**

> *(quietly, reluctantly, to oneself)*
>
> *"I know. My feeling reached a boundary.*
> *Time is ending this.*
> *I know. What I feel struck a wall.*
> *It is ending."*

---

### The Build — "I would rather..."

*Dynamics: mp → mf → f — growing, opening, no longer private*
*Register: rising from octave 4 toward 5 — reaching into near-future*
*Rhythm: still behind the beat but pushing now*

This is where the song transforms. The chords remain the same, but **everything else changes**:

**Chords:**
```
A  →  Bm  →  A  →  Bm
```

**But now:**
- The vocal rises higher (toward **future tense** in Harmonia)
- The dynamics swell (toward **public declaration**)
- The melody reaches up to **E** (Emotion) and **holds it** — she *stays* in feeling instead of falling back to knowing

| Element | Musical Event | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| Chord | A Major | *"I know what is true"* |
| Melody | **Sustained high E** | *"But I choose FEELING"* |
| Dynamic | f — forte | *(declared, not whispered)* |
| Register | Octave 5 | *"What I will choose — in the future"* |
| Chord change | → Bm | *"Even as it ends"* |
| Melody | Holds, resists falling | *"I will NOT return to knowing"* |

**The Build in Harmonia reads:**

> *(rising, no longer private, declaring)*
>
> *"I KNOW what is true.*
> *But I choose feeling — I choose it —*
> *Even as time takes everything.*
> *I will not look. I refuse to know.*
> *Give me feeling over knowledge.*
> *Give me the dark over this clarity."*

### This is the title phrase translated:

The song's title — "I'd Rather Go Blind" — in Harmonia becomes:

> **"I choose to lose knowledge rather than lose feeling."**

Or in chord language:

```
A (forte, high) → held E → Bm (soft, falling)
"I know"         "I feel"   "it ends"

Choosing to stay on E — choosing FEELING — 
rather than returning to A — KNOWING.
```

She would rather **stay suspended on E forever** — trapped in pure emotion — than resolve back to A, where the truth lives.

---

### The Refrain — The Repeated Declaration

*Dynamics: f — full, open, exposed*
*Register: octaves 4–5 — present bleeding into future*

```
A → Bm → A → Bm → (E7) → A
```

The **E7** appears here — the question chord:

| Chord | Translation |
|-------|-------------|
| A | *"I know"* |
| Bm | *"this is ending"* |
| A | *"I know"* |
| Bm | *"this is ending"* |
| **E7** | ***"Why do I still feel this?"*** |
| A | *"...I know."* |

**The Refrain in Harmonia:**

> *(openly, to the world)*
>
> *"I know and it is ending.*
> *I know and it is ending.*
> *Why do I still feel?*
> *...I know."*

That lone **E7** — the only *question* in the entire song — is devastating. It's the one moment where she breaks from her testimony and simply asks: ***Why does love persist past its own death?***

And the answer is just... **A**. "I know." She knows there is no answer.

---

### The Fade / Outro

*Dynamics: f → mp → pp — withdrawing*
*Register: slowly descending — sinking into past tense*

```
A → Bm → A → Bm → A → Bm → A → Bm...
```

The same two chords. Forever. Fading.

**In Harmonia:**

> *(growing quieter, withdrawing, becoming memory)*
>
> *"I know... it ends...*
> *I know... it ends...*
> *I know... it ends...*
> *...know... ...ends...*
> *......know............"*

The song doesn't conclude. It **disappears**. In Harmonia grammar, the descent in register means **it passes from present into past**. The fading dynamic means **it moves from public back to private, then to silence**.

The last thing we hear is the pendulum still swinging in the dark.

---

## Step 6: The Complete Translation

Assembling the full Harmonia poem:

---

**Für Elise spoke from A minor — "I do not understand."**
**This song speaks from A major — "I understand completely."**

---

*(slowly, reluctantly, to oneself)*

> I know. I know it is ending.
> My feeling reached a wall.
> Time is carrying this away.
> I know.

*(building, opening, no longer alone)*

> I know what is real.
> But I choose feeling over knowing.
> I choose the dark over this terrible clarity.
> Even as time takes everything —
> Let me keep this one thing I cannot name.

*(declared, fully)*

> I know and it is ending.
> I know and it is ending.
> Why do I still feel?
> ...I know.

*(fading, becoming the past)*

> I know... it ends...
> I know... it ends...
> ...know.........
>
> ...

## Step 7: The Deeper Pattern — Why Blues Works This Way

| Feature | Für Elise (Classical) | I'd Rather Go Blind (Blues) |
|---|---|---|
| **Key** | A minor (not-knowing) | A major (knowing) |
| **Core oscillation** | Am ↔ E (confusion ↔ feeling) | A ↔ Bm (knowing ↔ ending) |
| **Central pain** | "I feel but don't understand" | "I understand but can't stop feeling" |
| **Resolution** | None — ends on the question | None — fades into silence |
| **Harmonic complexity** | Multiple sections, key changes | Two chords. Just two. |
| **What the simplicity means** | — | There is nothing else to say. |

The blues uses **fewer chords** not because it is simpler, but because **the truth is simple**. Beethoven needed an entire compositional architecture to circle his confusion. Etta needed two chords and her voice, because she already knew everything. There was nothing left to search for.

In Harmonia, the blues is not a genre.

**It is a sentence that repeats because no response ever comes.**
