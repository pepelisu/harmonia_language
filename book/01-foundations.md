# Chapter 1: Foundations

## The Core Insight

A chord is already a kind of word.

When a pianist strikes C major, something happens that has no 
parallel in spoken language: **multiple meanings sound 
simultaneously.** Three notes — C, E, G — fuse into a single 
percept. Not a sequence. Not a list. A unity.

Spoken language is linear. One word follows another. You cannot 
say two words at the same time and be understood. But a chord 
IS multiple meanings at the same time, understood instantly, 
felt before analyzed.

This is the property Harmonia exploits. If chords already carry 
meaning — and centuries of music cognition research, film scoring, 
opera, and human experience confirm that they do — then a language 
built from chords inherits something no spoken language possesses: 
**polyphonic meaning.** The ability to say several things at once.

The question is not whether chords carry meaning. The question is 
whether that meaning can be systematized into something resembling 
a grammar.

Harmonia proposes that it can — imperfectly, partially, but 
genuinely.

## 1.1 The Alphabet: 12 Semantic Roots

Western music divides the octave into 12 chromatic pitches. These 
serve as the **root morphemes** of Harmonia — the irreducible 
units of meaning from which all words are built.

Each pitch anchors a **semantic domain**: a field of related 
meanings, not a single fixed definition.

### The Semantic Circle

The roots are arranged along the **circle of fifths**, so that 
acoustically related notes carry semantically related meanings:

```
                    C
                 (Being, Self)
            F                    G
      (Nature, Body)       (Connection, People)
         Bb                      D
    (Need, Desire)         (Action, Movement)
        Eb                       A
   (Home, Shelter)         (Mind, Knowledge)
        Ab                       E
  (Spirit, Mystery)        (Emotion, Feeling)
        Db                       B
 (Conflict, Boundary)      (Time, Change)
               Gb/F#
          (The Unknown,
           Possibility)
```

### The Complete Root Dictionary

| Root | Primary Domain | Secondary Meanings | Circle Position |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **C** | Being, Self, Existence | Identity, "I am," presence, the individual | 12 o'clock |
| **G** | Connection, People | Togetherness, friendship, "we," community | 1 o'clock |
| **D** | Action, Movement | Journey, work, agency, doing, departure | 2 o'clock |
| **A** | Mind, Knowledge | Truth, learning, thought, memory, understanding | 3 o'clock |
| **E** | Emotion, Feeling | Love, joy, sorrow, passion, the felt life | 4 o'clock |
| **B** | Time, Change | Aging, seasons, mortality, "once," "when" | 5 o'clock |
| **F#/Gb** | The Unknown, Possibility | What hasn't happened, the uncharted, potential | 6 o'clock |
| **Db/C#** | Conflict, Boundary | Opposition, limits, the threshold, borders | 7 o'clock |
| **Ab/G#** | Spirit, Abstract, Mystery | The sacred, transcendence, awe, the unseen | 8 o'clock |
| **Eb/D#** | Home, Shelter, Belonging | Place, safety, hearth, refuge, "where I'm from" | 9 o'clock |
| **Bb/A#** | Need, Desire, Want | Longing, hunger, hope, aspiration, "I wish" | 10 o'clock |
| **F** | Nature, Body, Physical World | Earth, flesh, food, health, matter, "what is" | 11 o'clock |

### A Critical Note on These Assignments

These mappings are a **creative choice, not a scientific 
discovery.** There is no psychoacoustic law that makes C 
inherently "self-like" or E inherently "emotional." The 
English-language mnemonics (C = Core, E = Emotion) are 
post-hoc justifications that happen to work in one language.

What IS grounded is the **adjacency principle**: notes that 
are harmonically close (adjacent on the circle of fifths) 
should carry semantically related meanings. C and G share 
most of their scale tones, so "Self" and "Connection" should 
be neighbors — because identity and relationship are 
intertwined. This constraint shaped the mapping, though it 
does not uniquely determine it.

A different mapping, following the same adjacency constraint, 
could produce equally valid results. See the 
[Honest Assessment](11-honest-assessment.md) for a full 
discussion of this limitation.

### Adjacency Relationships

Because the circle of fifths creates natural harmonic 
relationships, adjacent roots share semantic affinity:

| Adjacent Pair | Shared Meaning |
|---------------|---------------|
| C ↔ G | Self and Others — identity is formed through connection |
| G ↔ D | People and Action — we act upon each other |
| D ↔ A | Doing and Knowing — action produces understanding |
| A ↔ E | Mind and Heart — thought and feeling intertwine |
| E ↔ B | Feeling and Time — emotions live in time |
| B ↔ F# | Time and the Unknown — the future is time's unknown territory |
| F# ↔ Db | Unknown and Boundaries — where the unknown meets the known |
| Db ↔ Ab | Boundaries and Spirit — the edge of the known touches the transcendent |
| Ab ↔ Eb | Spirit and Home — sacred spaces are where we feel we belong |
| Eb ↔ Bb | Home and Desire — we long for where we belong |
| Bb ↔ F | Desire and Nature — need is rooted in the body |
| F ↔ C | Nature and Self — the body is the ground of being |

### Tritone Oppositions

Notes separated by a tritone (6 semitones — the maximum 
harmonic distance) carry complementary or opposing meanings:

| Root | Tritone Partner | Opposition |
|------|----------------|------------|
| C (Self) | F#/Gb (Unknown) | Who I am vs. what I might become |
| G (Connection) | Db (Conflict) | Togetherness vs. division |
| D (Action) | Ab (Spirit) | The physical act vs. the metaphysical |
| A (Knowledge) | Eb (Home) | What I know vs. where I belong |
| E (Emotion) | Bb (Desire) | What I feel vs. what I want |
| B (Time) | F (Nature) | Change vs. the enduring physical world |

When a tritone appears in a chord or progression, it creates 
tension between two opposing domains. The tritone — historically 
called *diabolus in musica* — is the most unstable interval. In 
Harmonia, it is the sound of two truths pulling against each 
other.

## 1.2 Morphology: Chord Qualities as Modifiers

Each root can be qualified by the type of chord built upon it. 
The chord quality functions as an adjective, adverb, or modal 
particle — it modifies *how* the root concept is experienced.

This layer is the most psychoacoustically grounded part of 
Harmonia. The emotional associations of chord qualities are 
well-documented in music perception research and are remarkably 
consistent across listeners and, to a significant degree, 
across cultures.

### Primary Qualities

| Quality | Semantic Function | Translation Pattern | Grounding |
|---------|------------------|--------------------| ----------|
| **Major** | Positive, present, affirmed | "[Root], yes" | Cross-culturally perceived as bright, stable |
| **Minor** | Negative, absent, reflective | "[Root], no / lost / remembered" | Cross-culturally perceived as dark, introspective |
| **Dominant 7th** | Question, seeking, tension | "[Root]? / Where is [root]?" | The b7 creates instability demanding resolution |
| **Major 7th** | Wonder, beauty, aspiration | "How beautiful [root] is" | The natural 7th creates a luminous, open quality |
| **Minor 7th** | Melancholy depth, sustained reflection | "[Root], lingering in absence" | Combines minor's darkness with 7th's depth |
| **Diminished** | Danger, warning, hidden threat | "Beware [root]!" | Equal minor 3rds create maximum instability |
| **Half-diminished** | Dissolving, structural failure | "[Root] is collapsing" | The b5 undermines the most stable interval |
| **Augmented** | Excess, intensification | "Too much [root]" | The #5 stretches the chord beyond natural limits |
| **Sus4** | Anticipation, withholding | "[Root], waiting / withheld" | The 4th replaces the defining 3rd — identity suspended |
| **Sus2** | Openness, undefined | "[Root], open / becoming" | The 2nd replaces the 3rd — identity not yet formed |
| **Power chord (5th)** | Raw, imperative, blunt | "[ROOT]!" (command) | Only root and 5th — no color, no nuance, pure force |
| **Add9** | Nuance, complexity | "[Root], with depth" | The 9th adds an upper layer of complexity |
| **6th** | Sweetness preserved, nostalgia | "[Root], with a memory inside" | The 6th adds warmth to a major chord |
| **Minor 6th** | Loss containing beauty | "[Root] gone, but beauty remains" | Major 6th inside a minor chord — bittersweet |

### Extensions and Alterations

Extensions beyond the 7th add layers of nuance:

| Extension | Semantic Addition |
|-----------|------------------|
| **9th** | Expanded awareness, wider perspective |
| **b9** | The darkest coloring — a question containing its terrible answer |
| **#9** | Reality distorted (the "Hendrix chord") |
| **11th** | Suspension within an extended chord — still waiting |
| **#11** | Lydian brightness — seeing beyond the ordinary |
| **13th** | The fullest possible expression — everything at once |
| **b13** | Shadowed completeness — everything present but darkened |

### Sample Dictionary Entries

To demonstrate how roots and qualities combine:

| Chord | Root + Quality | Translation |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| C | Being + affirmed | "I am." |
| Cm | Being + absent | "I am not. Isolation." |
| Cmaj7 | Being + wonder | "I am, and it is wondrous." |
| Csus4 | Being + waiting | "Not yet who I will become." |
| C/G | Being + grounded in Connection | "My self rests on togetherness." |
| Em | Emotion + absent | "Something is missing in my heart." |
| A7 | Knowledge + questioning | "Do you understand?" |
| Dsus4 | Action + suspended | "The lance on the rack. Not yet." |
| Bbmaj7 | Desire + wonder | "How beautiful it was to want." |
| Gm6 | Connection + lost + sweetness preserved | "Gone, but something remains." |

The complete dictionary of all 12 roots × 14 primary qualities 
(168 base words) is in the 
[Root Dictionary](../reference/root-dictionary.md).

## 1.3 Grammar: Beyond the Chord

A chord is a word. But a word is not a language. Language requires 
grammar — rules for how words combine, modify each other, and 
form sentences. Harmonia encodes grammar through six musical 
dimensions that exist independently of the chord itself.

### Octave = Tense

Where a chord is played on the keyboard determines **when** it 
exists:

| Octave Range | Tense | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Octaves 1–2 (very low) | Deep past — myth, ancient history | "Long, long ago..." |
| Octave 3 (low) | Past — memory, "I was" | "Not long ago there lived..." |
| Octave 4 (middle) | Present — now, "I am" | "I exist. This is happening." |
| Octave 5 (high) | Future — aspiration, "I will" | "Something is coming." |
| Octave 6 (very high) | Transcendent / Eternal | "Always. Forever." |

Movement between octaves within a phrase indicates temporal 
shift. Rising = moving toward the future. Falling = sinking 
into the past. Staying in one octave = trapped in one time.

### Inversion = Grammatical Case

Which note of the chord is in the bass determines the chord's 
grammatical role:

| Inversion | Bass Note | Function | Example |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Root position | Root in bass | **Subject / Agent** — the doer | C = "The self acts" |
| 1st inversion | 3rd in bass | **Object / Receiver** — acted upon | C/E = "Upon the self" |
| 2nd inversion | 5th in bass | **Modifier / Attribute** — describing | C/G = "The self, defined by connection" |

When a chord is placed over a bass note from a different domain, 
it creates a compound concept:

| Slash Chord | Translation |
|-------------|-------------|
| C/G | Self over Connection — "being, grounded in togetherness" |
| E/B | Emotion over Time — "feeling, carried by time" = memory |
| D/F | Action over Nature — "doing, rooted in the physical" = labor |

### Time Signature = Speech Mode

The meter of a piece determines what *kind* of speech is 
happening:

| Time Signature | Speech Mode | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **4/4** | Declarative | Testimony, prose, grounded statement |
| **3/4** | Incantation | Spell, enchantment, circular, poetic |
| **6/8** | Narrative | Storytelling, flowing, epic, ballad |
| **2/4** | Imperative | Command, march, directive, law |
| **3/8** | Intimate | Private, trapped, turning, confession |
| **5/4** | Unsettled | Asymmetric, something is wrong, alienation |
| **7/8** | Ecstatic / Prophetic | Beyond ordinary rhythm, vision, rapture |
| **Free time** | Stream of consciousness | No meter, dream, meditation |
| **Swing** | Retrospective | Leaning backward, memory, nostalgia |

### Dynamics = Register and Sincerity

How loudly a chord is played determines the social register of 
the speech:

| Dynamic | Register |
|---------|----------|
| **ppp** | Thought itself — barely conscious |
| **pp** | Whispered — a secret told to the closest |
| **p** | Gentle — honest, personal |
| **mp** | Conversational — normal speech |
| **mf** | Confident — speaking to a group |
| **f** | Urgent — this matters deeply |
| **ff** | Commanding — an order, a warning |
| **fff** | Beyond language — ecstasy or catastrophe |

**Dynamic mismatch = irony.** When the volume does not match 
the content's importance, the gap signals that the speaker is 
performing rather than speaking sincerely. A trivial idea 
played fortissimo is mock-heroic. A profound idea played 
pianissimo is understatement. This device was developed in 
the Don Quixote translation (Chapter 7) to handle Cervantes' 
narrative irony.

### Instrumentation = Speaker Identity

Different instruments represent different speakers:

| Instrument | Speaker |
|-----------|---------|
| **Piano** | The human individual — personal, vulnerable |
| **Strings** | The emotional community — shared feeling |
| **Brass** | The heroic / public voice — authority |
| **Celesta** | The otherworldly — magic, the supernatural |
| **Organ** | The institutional / sacred — church, law, eternity |
| **Classical guitar** | The storyteller — warm, ironic, narrative |
| **Choir** | Humanity itself — the collective, all of us |
| **Solo voice** | Irreducible personhood — this one soul |
| **Bells** | Time's voice — marking moments, announcing |
| **Brushes on drums** | Memory's texture — the whisper of the past |

Changes in instrumentation within a piece indicate changes 
in speaker or perspective. A celesta becoming strings means 
"I" becoming "we" (as in Hedwig's Theme). An organ becoming 
a solo piano means the institution becoming the individual 
(as in the Donne translation).

### Silence = Punctuation, Negation, and the Unsaid

| Type of Silence | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| Short rest (< 1 beat) | Comma — a breath |
| Quarter rest (1 beat) | Period — end of sentence |
| Half rest (2 beats) | Paragraph break |
| Full measure rest | Ellipsis... — something unsaid |
| Multi-measure rest | Negation or the unasked question |
| Fermata (held note → silence) | Letting meaning dissolve naturally |
| Grand Pause | The world stops — a rupture |

Silence is not the absence of meaning. It is often the presence 
of a meaning too large or too important for sound. In the Donne 
translation, the rest after the opening Cm chord IS the word 
"No" — the chord states the false premise and the silence 
denies it.

## 1.4 Sentences: How Chords Form Speech

### The Chord as Word

A single Harmonia chord is a compressed phrase:

```
Gm7 = G (Connection) + minor (absent) + 7th (depth)
    = "Connection, lingering in its absence"
    = "The togetherness that is gone, felt deeply"
```

A word in Harmonia simultaneously carries:
- **Root** = what the word is about (noun/topic)
- **Quality** = how it is experienced (adjective/mood)
- **Extension** = how deeply (adverb/intensifier)
- **Inversion** = its role in the sentence (case)
- **Register** = when it exists (tense)
- **Dynamic** = how it is spoken (sincerity/register)

### Two-Chord Phrases

The smallest meaningful sentence is two chords, because meaning 
emerges from relationship:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| X → Y | "[X] leads to [Y]" | C → G = "Self leads to Connection" |
| X → X7 | "[X] questions itself" | A → A7 = "Knowledge questions itself" |
| X → (silence) | "[X] — No." | Cm → rest = "Self alone — No." |
| X major → X minor | "[X] changes polarity" | F → Fm = "Nature whole → eroded" |

### Cadences as Sentence Types

How a phrase ends determines what kind of sentence it is:

| Cadence | Sentence Type | Meaning |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| V → I | Declarative | "This is true. Period." |
| IV → I | Benediction | "So be it. Amen." |
| I → V | Incomplete | "And then..." / "Which leads to..." |
| V → vi | Surprise | "You expected X, but Y is true" |
| → V (half cadence) | Question | "But what about...?" |
| → Xsus4 | Deliberately unresolved | "I won't tell you." |

### Key Signature as Context

The key of a composition sets the domain of the entire 
conversation:

| Element | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Root of key | The primary subject ("this is about...") |
| Quality of key | The stance (major = affirmed, minor = absent) |
| Foreign notes | Intruders, revelations, concepts from outside |

When a piece modulates (changes key), the conversation changes 
subject. A modulation from G major to G minor means: "We were 
talking about connection-affirmed; now we are talking about 
connection-lost."

## 1.5 Connective Tissue: Making It Flow (v1.1)

Chords without connectors produce telegrams:

> "Self. Connection. Action."

Chords with connectors produce speech:

> "The self *reaches toward* connection, *which stirs into* action."

Harmonia v1.1 introduces three layers of connection between 
chords:

### The Bass Line — Prepositions

The bass walks between chord roots, and the specific path it 
takes IS a preposition:

| Bass Movement | Translation |
|--------------|-------------|
| Step up | "toward," "and then" |
| Step down | "from," "therefore" |
| Chromatic approach (half step) | "inevitably," "becoming" |
| Held note (pedal) | "throughout all of this" |
| Leap | "suddenly," "but" |

### The Melody — Conjunctions

How the melody moves between chords determines the conjunction:

| Melodic Device | Translation |
|---------------|-------------|
| Step up into next chord tone | "and" |
| Step down into next chord tone | "then" |
| Leap up, step back down | "but" |
| Held note across chord change | "still," "while" |
| Appoggiatura (wrong note, then resolution) | "although," "despite" |
| Silence then chord | "however," "yet" |

### Inner Voices — Continuity

Between melody and bass, sustained inner notes provide the 
thread of continuity:

| Technique | Translation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Common tone held across chords | "One thing remains constant" |
| Chromatic inner line | "Gradually, imperceptibly, something changes" |
| Counter-melody | "Meanwhile..." |

The full connector system is detailed in 
[Chapter 10](10-connective-tissue.md).

---

## 1.6 The Irony Toolkit

Standard Harmonia expresses sincerity — affirmation, absence, 
wonder, danger. But some texts require irony — saying one thing 
while meaning another. Harmonia encodes irony through 
**mismatch** between layers:

| Device | How It Works | Translation |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unresolved suspension** | A sus4 that never resolves | "I could tell you, but I won't" |
| **Dynamic mismatch** | Volume doesn't match importance | "The speaker is performing" |
| **Grace note** | Quick crushed note before the chord | "The narrator's wink" |
| **Register mismatch** | Noble register for humble content | "Mock-heroic" |
| **Quality mismatch** | Major chord for sad content | "Dark comedy" |

These tools were developed in the Don Quixote translation 
(Chapter 7) and are available for any text that speaks with 
a knowing smile.

---

## 1.7 Summary: What a Harmonia Sentence Contains

Every moment of Harmonia speech carries information in six 
simultaneous dimensions:

```
WHAT:    Root (12 domains — C, G, D, A, E, B, F#, Db, Ab, Eb, Bb, F)
HOW:     Quality (major, minor, 7th, dim, aug, sus4, sus2, etc.)
WHEN:    Octave (past, present, future)
ROLE:    Inversion (subject, object, modifier)
TONE:    Dynamic (whispered, spoken, shouted)
FLOW:    Connectors (bass walk, melodic bridge, inner voice)

+ Meter (what kind of speech)
+ Instrument (who is speaking)
+ Silence (what is not said)
+ Irony tools (what is said but not meant)
```

No spoken language can encode this much simultaneously. Spoken 
language compensates with speed, vocabulary size, and context. 
Harmonia compensates with **polyphony** — the ability to layer 
meanings on top of each other in a single instant.

This is both the language's greatest strength and its deepest 
limitation. It can say "connection-lost-with-lingering-sweetness-
in-the-past-whispered-while-time-persists-beneath" in a single 
chord (Gm6, octave 3, pp, with a B pedal tone). No spoken 
language can do this.

But it cannot say "please pass the salt." No chord can do that.

Harmonia is a language of the abstract, the emotional, and the 
existential. It is not a language of the practical. What it can 
say, it says with a density and simultaneity that nothing else 
achieves. What it cannot say, it cannot say at all.

That boundary — between what music can and cannot express — is 
itself one of the most interesting things the project reveals.
