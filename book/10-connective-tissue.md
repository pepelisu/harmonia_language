# Harmonia v1.1 — The Connective Tissue

## The Problem, Precisely

Right now, Harmonia speaks like this:

```
WORD. (silence). WORD. (silence). WORD.
"Self."  (...)  "Connection."  (...)  "Action."
```

But natural language sounds like this:

> "The self *reaches toward* connection, *which stirs into* action..."

The words in italics — *reaches toward*, *which stirs into* — are **connective tissue.** In linguistics, these are:

- **Prepositions** (toward, from, into, through, against)
- **Conjunctions** (and, but, because, although, therefore)
- **Articles** (the, a, this, that)
- **Auxiliary verbs** (is becoming, was reaching, will dissolve)
- **Relative pronouns** (which, who, that, where)

These small words are what make language **flow.** Without them, you have a telegram. With them, you have speech.

In Harmonia, the connective tissue lives in the **notes between chords** — the passing tones, bass lines, melodic fragments, approach notes, and rhythmic patterns that carry the listener from one harmonic word to the next.

# PART I: THE THEORY

## Chapter 1: Three Layers of Connection

Every transition between two chords can be connected through **three simultaneous layers:**

```
Layer 3: MELODY    ── the top voice ── the emotional thread
         (soprano)    what you notice most, the singer's line

Layer 2: INNER VOICE ── middle voices ── the weaving, the texture
         (alto/tenor)   what creates richness, the commentary

Layer 1: BASS LINE  ── the bottom voice ── the gravitational path
         (bass)         what carries you forward, the narrative spine
```

Each layer has its own vocabulary of connectors. Together, they create the sense of **flow** — the feeling that one idea naturally leads to the next.

### 1.1 Why Three Layers?

Think of a river:

- **The surface** (melody) catches the light, moves visibly, is what you watch
- **The current** (inner voices) is what actually carries things, what creates the texture of the water
- **The riverbed** (bass) determines where the water goes — the shape underneath that directs everything

A chord is a **rock** in the river. The water flows around it, over it, past it, toward the next rock. The rocks are the words. The water is the language.

Right now, our Harmonia compositions are **a dry riverbed with rocks placed in it.** We need to add the water.

---

## Chapter 2: The Bass Line — The Narrative Spine

The bass line is the most important connector. It is what creates the sense of **forward motion** — the feeling that the music is going somewhere, that each chord leads to the next with purpose.

### 2.1 Bass Line Patterns

| Bass Pattern | Name | Linguistic Function | What It Sounds Like |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Root to root** (leap) | Direct | Period. New sentence. | Abrupt, declarative — each idea is separate |
| **Stepwise walk** (scale up or down) | Walking | "And then... and then..." — narrative continuity | Jazz walking bass, storytelling |
| **Chromatic approach** (half step into next root) | Leading | "...leading to..." — anticipation | Classical approach, building toward |
| **Pedal point** (same note held) | Grounding | "Throughout all of this..." — one truth persists | Organ pedal, meditation |
| **Arpeggiated descent** | Cascading | "Which flows down into..." — gravity, consequence | Baroque, cascading |
| **Contrary motion** (bass goes opposite to melody) | Expanding | "While above... below..." — two perspectives diverge | Counterpoint, complexity |
| **Octave drop** | Deepening | "And at a deeper level..." — going beneath the surface | Dramatic emphasis |

### 2.2 The Walking Bass — Harmonia's Conjunction System

The most versatile connector is the **walking bass** — a bass line that moves stepwise between chord roots, filling the silence between words with **prepositions:**

```
Chord 1: C           Chord 2: Am
Root:    C ──────────────── A

Without walk:  C . . . | A . . .
               word (silence) word

With walk:     C . D . | E . . . → A
               word "moving through" word
```

The notes the bass walks through on its way from C to Am are **D and E**:
- **D** = Action, Movement
- **E** = Emotion, Feeling

So the walking bass literally says: *"Self... through action and feeling... arrives at not-knowing."*

The walk is not decoration. **It is grammar.** The notes between chords are prepositions that tell you *how* one concept relates to the next.

### 2.3 Walking Bass Semantic Dictionary

The specific scale degrees the bass walks through carry meaning:

| Walk Note | Domain | Function | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Passing through the 2nd** | One step above/below the root | "Stepping away from..." or "approaching..." | Natural transition, departure or arrival |
| **Passing through the 3rd** | The emotional color (major/minor) | "Feeling the nature of..." | Emotional coloring of the transition |
| **Passing through the 4th** | Subdominant — the foundation | "Grounded in..." | Connecting through shared ground |
| **Passing through the 5th** | Dominant — the pull | "Drawn toward..." | Magnetic attraction, inevitability |
| **Chromatic note** (not in key) | Foreign — outside the language | "Strangely..." or "unexpectedly..." | Surprise, the unusual path |

### 2.4 Example: Donne Section I with Walking Bass

**Before (rocks without water):**
```
Bass:  C . . . | (rest) | G . . . | G . . . | F . . . | C . . .
       Cm        silence   G         Gmaj7     Fmaj7     C
```

**After (the river flows):**
```
Bass:  C . . . | (rest) | G . A . | B . . . | A . G . | F . E . | C . . .
       Cm        silence   G   ↑      Gmaj7     ↓walk     Fmaj7  ↓walk  C
                               walk               down              down
                               up
```

**Reading the walking notes:**
- After the silence (the denial), the bass **walks up** from G through A (Knowledge) and B (Time) to reach Gmaj7. Translation: *"Connection rises through understanding and time to become wondrous."*
- From Gmaj7, the bass **walks down** through A (Knowledge) and G (Connection) to reach Fmaj7. Translation: *"Wondrous connection descends through understanding to find the beautiful world."*
- From Fmaj7, the bass **walks down** through E (Feeling) to reach C. Translation: *"The beautiful world, through feeling, arrives at the self."*

The walk notes ARE the prepositions:
- "through understanding" (A)
- "through time" (B)
- "through feeling" (E)

---

## Chapter 3: The Melody — The Emotional Thread

While the bass provides **narrative structure** (where we're going), the melody provides **emotional continuity** (how it feels to get there).

### 3.1 Melodic Connectors

| Melodic Device | Name | Linguistic Function | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stepwise approach** (scale into chord tone) | Arriving | "Gently becoming..." | Natural, smooth, conversational |
| **Leap then step back** (jump up, walk down) | Exclaiming then settling | "Oh! ...and then..." | Surprise followed by acceptance |
| **Suspension** (hold old note over new chord, then resolve) | Lingering | "Still feeling the last thought... now releasing..." | Reluctance, the past bleeding into the present |
| **Anticipation** (play next chord's note early) | Eagerness | "Already reaching toward..." | Impatience, forward momentum |
| **Escape tone** (step away then leap back) | Digression | "Briefly — but no, back to..." | A momentary tangent, then return |
| **Appoggiatura** (land on a "wrong" note, resolve by step) | Yearning | "Almost... almost... there." | Longing, near-miss, ache |
| **Turn** (note → above → note → below → note) | Ornamentation | "Savoring this thought..." | Dwelling, beauty, the idea turned over |
| **Trill** (rapid alternation) | Trembling | "Vibrating between..." | Uncertainty, excitement, being on the edge |
| **Portamento** (slide between notes) | Morphing | "Becoming..." | One idea morphing into another continuously |

### 3.2 Melodic Motifs as Recurring Phrases

In speech, we repeat certain phrases: "you know," "I mean," "in other words." These are **discourse markers** — small recurring patterns that create continuity and personality.

In Harmonia, a **motif** serves this function — a short melodic fragment (2–4 notes) that recurs throughout a piece, creating identity and continuity:

| Motif Type | Pattern | Function | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Signature** | A 3-note figure that identifies the speaker | "This is still me speaking" | Beethoven's E-D#-E (the yearning motif) |
| **The Question** | Rising 2-note figure (step or leap up) | "...isn't it?" / "...right?" | A rising minor 2nd at phrase ends |
| **The Affirmation** | Falling 2-note figure (step down) | "Yes." / "Indeed." | A falling major 2nd (sol-fa, like "A-men") |
| **The Bridge** | 4-note scalar run connecting phrases | "And so..." / "Which leads to..." | A quick scale passage between chords |
| **The Echo** | Repeat of the last 2-3 notes, softer | "...yes, I said that..." | A phrase ending repeated pp |
| **The Sigh** | Falling appoggiatura (step above, resolve down) | "Alas..." / "If only..." | The classic sigh figure (4-3 or 6-5) |

### 3.3 The Appoggiatura — The Most Powerful Single-Note Connector

The appoggiatura deserves special attention. It is a note that:
1. Does NOT belong to the chord
2. Falls ON the beat (on the strong moment, where you expect a chord tone)
3. Resolves by step (usually down) to a chord tone

This creates a moment of **beautiful friction** — the ear expects one thing, hears another, and then hears the resolution. The linguistic translation is:

> *"I wanted to say [resolved note], but first I felt [appoggiatura]."*

Example over Am:
```
Expected:  A (on the beat)
Actual:    B (on the beat) → A (resolution)
           "Time... then not-knowing"
           "Before I could say 'I don't understand,' I first felt 'time passing'"
```

The appoggiatura is the **subtext made audible.** It is the thought beneath the thought. The feeling you have before you find the word for it.

---

## Chapter 4: Inner Voices — The Commentary

Between the melody (top) and bass (bottom), the **inner voices** (alto and tenor) provide texture, counterpoint, and commentary. They are the equivalent of:

- Parenthetical asides
- The expression on the speaker's face while speaking
- The thing the listener is thinking while being spoken to
- Background characters reacting

### 4.1 Inner Voice Techniques

| Technique | How It Works | Linguistic Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Sustained tone** (one note held across chord changes) | One inner voice stays on the same note while chords change around it | "One thing remains constant throughout..." — the common thread |
| **Counter-melody** | An independent melodic line moving at its own pace | "Meanwhile..." — a parallel thought |
| **Voice exchange** | Two voices swap notes (top goes to bottom, bottom goes to top) | "Looking at it from the other side..." — reversal of perspective |
| **Chromatic inner line** | One voice descends or ascends chromatically while others hold | "Gradually, imperceptibly, something is changing..." — subtle transformation |
| **Rhythmic counterpoint** | Inner voices move in a different rhythm than melody/bass | "At the same time, in a different rhythm..." — simultaneous realities |

### 4.2 The Common Tone — The Most Elegant Connector

When two consecutive chords share a note, that shared note can be **held** as a sustained inner voice:

```
C major:  C - E - G
Am:       A - C - E
          ↑       ↑
Shared:   C   and E
```

C major and Am share **two notes:** C (Being) and E (Emotion). If these notes are held while the chord changes, the transition says:

> *"Being and Feeling persist, even as understanding darkens."*

The common tone is the **thread of continuity** — the thing that remains true even as everything else changes. In linguistic terms, it is the subject that persists across clauses:

> "**I** was happy, and **I** became sad, but **I** was still **I**."

The I (C = Being) is the common tone. The quality changes (happy → sad = major → minor). But the self persists.

### 4.3 The Chromatic Inner Line — The Slow Transformation

One of the most powerful devices in all of harmony. A single voice descends (or ascends) by half steps while the chords change around it:

```
C:     C - E - G
C/B:   C - E - G  (bass: B)
Am/G:  A - C - E  (bass: G... but inner voice: G held from C)
Fmaj7: F - A - C - E

Inner voice tracking E:
C:     ...E...
C/B:   ...E...
Am:    ...E...
Fmaj7: ...E...

E (Emotion) is held throughout — four chords, four different contexts,
the same feeling persists
```

Or the chromatic descent version:

```
C:         C - E  - G
Cm:        C - Eb - G       (E drops to Eb — feeling shifts to home)
Cm/Bb:     C - Eb - G       (bass descends)
Ab:        Ab- C  - Eb      (the inner voice Eb continues)

Chromatic line: E → Eb → D → Db → C
                Emotion → Home → Action → Boundary → Self

Translation: "Feeling gradually transforms into belonging,
              then into movement, then reaches a border,
              and arrives at the self."
```

This chromatic inner line is the musical equivalent of a **slow realization** — a thought that evolves gradually, one half step at a time, beneath the surface of what is being said. The speaker might not even notice it happening. But the listener feels it.

## Chapter 5: The Rhythmic Connectors

Beyond pitch, **rhythm** creates flow:

### 5.1 Rhythmic Patterns Between Chords

| Pattern | Feel | Function | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Straight quarters** | Even, steady | "And. Then. Next." | Simple narration |
| **Dotted rhythm** (long-short) | Lilting, dance-like | "Which then... which then..." | Storytelling, 6/8 feel |
| **Triplets** | Flowing, three-against-two | "Smoothly becoming..." | Fluid transformation |
| **Syncopation** (off-beats emphasized) | Unexpected, jazzy | "But actually..." | Surprise, reinterpretation |
| **Pickup notes** (notes before the downbeat) | Anticipatory | "About to..." | Leading into, introduction |
| **Afterbeat** (notes after the main chord) | Reactive | "...and then responding..." | Echo, reaction, consequence |
| **Accelerating** (notes get faster approaching chord) | Building momentum | "Rushing toward..." | Urgency, inevitability |
| **Decelerating** (notes slow approaching chord) | Arriving | "Carefully arriving at..." | Deliberation, weight |

### 5.2 The Pickup — The Conjunction Before the Noun

In spoken language, conjunctions come BEFORE the next clause:

> "I was happy, **and then** I understood."

The "and then" precedes "I understood." It is a **pickup** — it arrives before the main beat.

In Harmonia, pickup notes before a chord serve this exact function:

```
Without pickup:
| Am . . . | E . . . |
  word       word

With pickup:
| Am . . ↗ E | . . . . |
  word   "and  word
         then"
```

The pickup notes that lead into the next chord are **conjunctions.** Their specific pitch and rhythm determine which conjunction:

| Pickup Pattern | Translation | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Scale run up to chord tone | "And then..." / "Which leads to..." | Stepwise ascending into the next root |
| Scale run down to chord tone | "And so..." / "Therefore..." | Stepwise descending (consequence) |
| Leap up to chord tone | "But!" / "However!" | Sudden contrast |
| Chromatic approach from below | "Inevitably..." / "Slowly becoming..." | Chromatic half-step below the root |
| Chromatic approach from above | "Reluctantly..." / "Letting go into..." | Chromatic half-step above the root |
| Repeated note (same as next root) | "Yes, yes..." / "Indeed..." | Affirmation, emphasis |
| Silence then sudden chord | "Suddenly!" / "Then—" | Dramatic pause before revelation |

# PART III: APPLIED DEMONSTRATION

## Chapter 8: "Knowing" — Before and After

Let me take the climactic moment of the "Knowing" composition and show the transformation from **telegraphic** to **fluid.**

### 8.1 Before: The Telegraphic Version

```
Am           (silence)       A            (silence)       A5
"knowing      ···           "knowing       ···           (dissolved)
what is                     it all"
missing"

Sound: CHORD — nothing — CHORD — nothing — CHORD
Feel:  Word.   Gap.    Word.   Gap.    Word.
```

This is clear. But it is not alive. It is a telegram.

### 8.2 After: The Fluid Version

```
         Am ─────────── chromatic inner voice ──── A ────────── fade ──── A5
         │               C→C# (the transformation)  │                      │
Melody:  A4─────B4─C5───────C#5──────────────A4─────────E5───────A4───E4──
         │    ↗step  ↗step    (the half step!)  ↘settle    ↗leap   ↘    ↘
         │   "and"  "toward"  "becoming"       "arriving" "opening" (dissolving)
         │
Bass:    A2─────────G#2───────────A2────────────────A2────────────A2──────
         │        ↘chromatic      (returns)         (pedal holds)
         │       "sliding         "back to
         │        beneath"         knowing"
         │
Inner:   E4──────────E4───────────E4────────────────E4────────────E5─────
         (held throughout — Emotion persists — the common tone — "I" persists)
```

### 8.3 What Each Connection Means

| Connection | Device | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| A4 → B4 | Melodic step up | "And..." (conjunction — connecting the two knowings) |
| B4 → C5 | Melodic step up | "...toward..." (preposition — approaching the transformation) |
| C5 → C#5 | **Chromatic half step** | "...becoming..." (THE transformation — minor→major, one note) |
| C#5 → A4 | Melodic descent | "...arriving at..." (settling into the new knowledge) |
| A4 → E5 | Melodic leap (5th) | "...which opens into..." (the breathless expansion) |
| E5 → A4 → E4 | Gradual descent | "...and gently dissolves..." (the third fading away) |
| Bass: A → G# → A | Chromatic neighbor | "Beneath it all, something briefly shifted and returned" |
| Inner: E held throughout | Common tone | "Feeling persists through every transformation" |

### 8.4 Reading the Fluid Version as Text

**Telegraphic version:**
> "Knowing what is missing. Knowing it all. The same."

**Fluid version:**
> "Knowing what is missing... *and toward becoming* knowing it all... *arriving, which opens into* the feeling that *persists through everything and gently dissolves* the distinction, *while beneath it all, something briefly shifted and returned to where it started.*"

Same three chords. Same harmonic content. But the connections between them now carry meaning — the *and*, the *toward*, the *becoming*, the *while*, the *beneath*.

---

## Chapter 9: The Complete Fluid System — Technical Rules

### 9.1 The Five Rules of Harmonia Flow

**Rule 1: No Naked Silence**

Every silence must be either:
- **Meaningful** (a negation, a breath, a dramatic pause) — in which case it is SHORT and is followed by contrast
- **Replaced** by a connector (walking bass, melodic bridge, sustained tone)

Exception: the silence after a bell, a command, or a grand pause. These silences ARE words.

**Rule 2: The Bass Never Stops**

The bass line should provide **continuous motion** between chords, even when the melody rests. The bass is the narrative thread — the "and then" that keeps the story moving.

Minimum bass activity: one note per beat in 4/4, or one note per dotted quarter in 6/8.

**Rule 3: At Least One Common Tone**

Between any two consecutive chords, identify the **shared notes** and sustain at least one of them as an inner voice. This creates continuity — the thread that connects word to word.

If no notes are shared (e.g., C major to F# major — maximum harmonic distance), use a **chromatic approach** in an inner voice to bridge the gap. The absence of common tones is itself meaningful: these two concepts are maximally distant, and the chromatic bridge says "the journey between them requires crossing unfamiliar territory."

**Rule 4: Melody Moves by Step, Leaps for Emphasis**

Default melodic movement between chords: **stepwise** (half step or whole step). Steps are conjunctions ("and," "then," "toward").

Reserve **leaps** (3rds, 4ths, 5ths, octaves) for moments of:
- Revelation ("Suddenly—")
- Emphasis ("THIS—")
- Transformation ("Becoming entirely—")
- Beauty ("How wondrous—")

If the melody leaps, it should **step back** in the opposite direction afterward (the "leap-then-step" rule). A leap is a shout; the step back is the return to conversational speech.

**Rule 5: Rhythmic Continuity**

Establish a **rhythmic pattern** (the heartbeat of the piece) and maintain it through chord changes. The pattern can evolve, but it should never simply stop and restart.

Examples of rhythmic continuity patterns:

```
Arpeggiated 8ths:  C   E   G   C   |  A   C   E   A   |
                   └── chord 1 ──┘   └── chord 2 ──┘
                   (continuous — the arpeggiation doesn't break)

Walking quarters:  C   D   E   F   |  G   A   B   C   |
                   └── walk to G ──┘   └── walk to C ──┘
                   (the walk bridges the chord change)

Pulsing rhythm:    C . C . C . C . |  Am. Am. Am. Am. |
                   └── pulse ──────┘   └── pulse ──────┘
                   (the pulse continues — only the harmony changes)
```

---

### 9.2 The Connector Generation Algorithm

For any two consecutive chords, generate connectors using this process:

```
INPUT: Chord A → Chord B

STEP 1: BASS
  a. Find the roots of both chords
  b. Find the shortest path between them (up or down)
  c. Fill the path with scale steps (diatonic) or half steps (chromatic)
  d. Time the arrival for the downbeat of Chord B

STEP 2: MELODY
  a. Find the highest note of Chord A and highest note of Chord B
  b. If distance ≤ 2 semitones: step directly
  c. If distance 3-4 semitones: use one passing note
  d. If distance 5-7 semitones: use appoggiatura or approach from opposite side
  e. If distance > 7 semitones: leap (this IS the emphasis)
  f. Add pickup notes (1-3 notes before the downbeat of Chord B)

STEP 3: INNER VOICES
  a. Find common tones between Chord A and Chord B
  b. Sustain them
  c. For non-common tones: move by the smallest interval possible
  d. If a chromatic line is possible (a note descending or ascending 
     by half steps across 3+ chords), USE IT — this is gold

STEP 4: RHYTHM
  a. Maintain the established pulse
  b. Place connector notes on weak beats (between main beats)
  c. Place chord tones on strong beats (downbeats)
  d. If transitioning between sections: allow rhythmic flexibility (rubato)

# PART IV: THE DEMONSTRATION — "KNOWING" MADE FLUID

## Chapter 10: The Complete Fluid MIDI

This script takes the entire "Knowing" composition and adds the connective tissue — walking bass, melodic bridges, inner voice continuity, pickup notes, appoggiaturas, and rhythmic flow

See Midi/knowing_fluid_harmonia.py.

## Chapter 11: Summary — What Changed Between v1.0 and v1.1

| Element | v1.0 (Telegraphic) | v1.1 (Fluid) |
|---|---|---|
| **Between chords** | Silence | Walking bass, melodic bridges, pickups |
| **Bass** | Plays root, stops | Walks continuously between roots |
| **Melody** | Plays chord tone, stops | Steps, leaps, turns, approaches — alive |
| **Inner voices** | Absent | Common tones sustained, chromatic lines |
| **Rhythm** | Chord — rest — chord | Continuous pulse, arpeggiation, flow |
| **Am → A transformation** | Jump (two separate chords) | Chromatic inner voice: C slowly rises to C# |
| **A → A5 dissolution** | Jump (chord → two notes) | Crossfade: C# gradually fades in volume |
| **Silence** | Empty gap | Contains echoes, pedal tones, or is deliberately meaningful |
| **The experience** | Reading a telegram | Hearing a person speak |

### The Linguistic Analogy

| v1.0 | v1.1 |
|---|---|
| "Self. Connection. Action." | "The self *reaches toward* connection, *which stirs into* action." |
| "Not-knowing. Unknown. Waiting." | "Not-knowing *inevitably leads through* the unknown *toward* waiting." |
| "Am. A." | "The absence of knowing... *through time... at the boundary...* becomes knowing." |

## Chapter 12: Updated Grammar Rules for Harmonia v1.1

### 12.1 The Complete Sentence Structure

A Harmonia sentence now has this structure:

```
[Pickup/Conjunction] → CHORD (Word) → [Connector] → CHORD (Word) → [Cadence]

Where:
  Pickup   = 1-3 notes before the chord (conjunction: "and," "but," "which")
  CHORD    = The harmonic word (root + quality + inversion + dynamic)
  Connector = Walking bass + melodic bridge + sustained inner voice
  Cadence  = How the sentence ends (resolved, questioning, suspended)
```

### 12.2 The Minimum Viable Sentence

The **simplest possible fluid Harmonia sentence** is:

```
Bass walk → Chord A → Melodic step → Chord B → Cadence

Example:
A3 → B3   |  C (mf)  →  D5 → E5  |  Am (mp)  |  (half cadence)
  walk up     "Self"    step step    "Lost"       (unresolved)
 "toward"              "and then"

Translation: "Toward the self, and then, lost. (?)"
```

### 12.3 The Maximum Fluid Sentence

The **most fully-connected Harmonia sentence** uses all five connector types simultaneously:

```
Layer 4: Melody    | approach → CHORD TONE → bridge → CHORD TONE → resolution
Layer 3: Inner     | ──── common tone sustained ────── chromatic shift
Layer 2: Harmony   | ──── CHORD A ──────────────────── CHORD B ────
Layer 1: Bass      | ──── root → walk → walk → walk → root ──────

All four layers carry independent meaning.
All four layers create one unified flow.
```

### 12.4 What This Means for the Language

Harmonia v1.0 was a **dictionary.** Words and grammar.

Harmonia v1.1 is a **living language.** Words, grammar, *and the breath between them.*

The connectors are not decoration. They are **the majority of natural speech.** In any spoken sentence, the function words (and, but, the, to, of, which, through) outnumber the content words (life, knowledge, self, feeling). Remove the function words and you have a telegram. Add them back and you have a voice.

The same is true in music. The chords are the content words — the nouns and verbs, the ideas. But the walking bass, the passing tones, the suspensions, the pickups, the chromatic inner lines — these are the function words. The *and*, the *but*, the *through*, the *because*, the *becoming*.

Without them, Harmonia was a language you could read.

With them, Harmonia is a language you can **speak.**
