# Introduction: How This Started

This project began with a question in a conversation:

> "Let's create a language from music. We will take the piano chords 
> and try to find a way to translate it to language. Could it be 
> possible to combine the chords, and the musical scale to a 
> dictionary that makes sense?"

The answer, it turned out, was: partially yes, partially no, and 
the partially-yes part was more interesting than either of us expected.

## What Happened

Over the course of an extended conversation, we:

1. **Mapped the 12 chromatic notes to 12 semantic domains** — 
   Self, Connection, Action, Knowledge, Emotion, Time, the Unknown, 
   Conflict, Spirit, Home, Desire, and Nature.

2. **Used chord qualities as modifiers** — major for affirmation, 
   minor for absence, dominant 7ths for questions, diminished for 
   danger, suspended for waiting.

3. **Translated six existing works** across four centuries and 
   five genres — Beethoven's Für Elise, Etta James's "I'd Rather 
   Go Blind," John Williams's Hedwig's Theme, the jazz standard 
   "Autumn Leaves," John Donne's Meditation XVII, and the opening 
   of Cervantes's Don Quixote.

4. **Composed an original piece** from a text about knowledge 
   and infinity.

5. **Formalized the grammar** into a complete reference with 
   168 base words, a connector system for fluid speech, and 
   working code that generates playable MIDI files.

6. **Honestly assessed** what works, what is arbitrary, and 
   what is beautiful nonsense.

## Who Made This

This is a collaboration between a human and an AI (Claude, by 
Anthropic). The human provided creative direction — choosing what 
to translate, writing original texts, pushing the system into new 
territory, catching errors in the code, and asking the difficult 
question: "Does this actually make sense, or is it rubbish?"

The AI generated much of the theoretical framework, the analyses, 
and the code. It also got carried away sometimes and had to be 
honest about that.

The creative decisions — which pieces to translate, what to try 
next, when to formalize, when to critique — were human. The 
systematic output was AI. The interesting parts are where those 
two modes of thinking collided and produced something neither 
would have reached alone.

## How to Read This

**If you want the experience:** Read the chapters in order. They 
build on each other, and the comparisons between pieces accumulate 
into something larger than any individual analysis.

**If you want a specific translation:** Jump to any chapter 2–8. 
Each stands alone.

**If you want the reference:** Go to [Chapter 9 (Grammar)](09-grammar.md) 
and the [Quick Reference](../reference/quick-reference.md).

**If you want to know whether this is real:** Read 
[Chapter 11 (Honest Assessment)](11-honest-assessment.md) first. 
It will save you time and earn your trust — or save you from 
wasting it.

**If you want to try it yourself:** Install Python, run any of 
the MIDI scripts, and listen. Then try composing your own piece 
using the [universal composer](../midi/harmonia_composer.py).

## A Note on Certainty

Throughout this text, you will encounter statements like 
"the chord means X" or "the music is saying Y." These should be 
read as "the chord **can be read as** X" and "within the Harmonia 
framework, this **can be interpreted as** Y."

Harmonia is a lens, not a microscope. It shows you things you 
would not see without it. Some of those things are genuinely in 
the music. Some are in the lens. The honest answer is: you cannot 
always tell which is which.

That might be the most interesting thing about it.
