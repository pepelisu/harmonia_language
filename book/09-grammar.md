# PART I: FOUNDATIONS

## Chapter 1: The Nature of the Language

Harmonia is a **tonal-harmonic constructed language** in which meaning is encoded simultaneously through:

1. **Pitch** (which note) → semantic domain
2. **Harmony** (which chord quality) → attitude, polarity, modifier
3. **Time** (register, tempo, rhythm) → tense, aspect, mode
4. **Dynamics** (volume) → register, urgency, sincerity
5. **Timbre** (instrument) → speaker identity
6. **Silence** (rests) → punctuation, negation, the unsaid

Unlike spoken languages, which are **linear** (one word at a time), Harmonia is **polyphonic** — multiple meanings can sound simultaneously. A single chord already contains 3–7 notes, each contributing semantic content. This makes Harmonia more like thought itself: parallel, layered, simultaneous.

### 1.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Psychoacoustic grounding** | Meanings align with how humans naturally perceive sound | Minor = reflective/absent (cross-culturally perceived as "sad") |
| **Circle-of-fifths topology** | Related meanings occupy adjacent positions on the circle of fifths | G (Connection) and C (Self) share most notes — because connection and selfhood are intertwined |
| **Compositional meaning** | Complex meanings are built by combining simple elements | Em = Emotion + Absent = "something is missing in my heart" |
| **Contextual enrichment** | The same chord means different things in different keys and progressions | Cm in Donne = "the false premise of isolation"; Cm in Cervantes = "the self, consumed by the material" |
| **Musical naturalness** | Valid Harmonia sentences should sound like plausible music | The grammar follows voice-leading and harmonic gravity |

## Chapter 2: The Alphabet — 12 Semantic Roots

The 12 chromatic pitches of the Western scale serve as the **root morphemes** of Harmonia. Each root anchors a **semantic domain** — a field of related meanings.

### 2.1 The Semantic Circle

The roots are arranged along the **circle of fifths**, so that acoustically related notes carry semantically related meanings:

```
                    C
                 (Being, Self)
            F                   G
      (Nature, Body)      (Connection, People)
         Bb                     D
    (Need, Desire)        (Action, Movement)
        Eb                      A
   (Home, Shelter)        (Mind, Knowledge)
        Ab                      E
  (Spirit, Mystery)       (Emotion, Feeling)
        Db                      B
 (Conflict, Boundary)     (Time, Change)
               Gb/F#
          (The Unknown,
           Possibility)
```

### 2.2 Complete Root Dictionary

| Root | Primary Domain | Secondary Meanings | Mnemonic | Circle Position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C** | Being, Self, Existence | Identity, "I am," presence, the person | C = Core | 12 o'clock |
| **G** | Connection, People, Togetherness | Society, friendship, "we," companionship | G = Gather | 1 o'clock |
| **D** | Action, Movement, Doing | Journey, work, agency, will, departure | D = Do | 2 o'clock |
| **A** | Mind, Knowledge, Understanding | Truth, learning, thought, memory, information | A = Awareness | 3 o'clock |
| **E** | Emotion, Feeling, Heart | Love, joy, sorrow, passion, the felt life | E = Emotion | 4 o'clock |
| **B** | Time, Change, Sequence | Aging, seasons, mortality, "once," "when" | B = Before/Beyond | 5 o'clock |
| **F#/Gb** | The Unknown, Possibility | What hasn't happened, mystery, potential, the uncharted | F# = Far | 6 o'clock |
| **Db/C#** | Conflict, Boundary, Threshold | Opposition, limit, edge, war, challenge, the border between | Db = Divide | 7 o'clock |
| **Ab/G#** | Spirit, Abstract, Mystery | The sacred, the metaphysical, awe, transcendence, the unseen | Ab = Above | 8 o'clock |
| **Eb/D#** | Home, Shelter, Belonging | Place, safety, hearth, refuge, "where I am from" | Eb = Estate | 9 o'clock |
| **Bb/A#** | Need, Desire, Want | Longing, hunger, hope, dream, aspiration, "I wish" | Bb = Beckoning | 10 o'clock |
| **F** | Nature, Body, Physical World | Earth, flesh, food, health, matter, "what is" | F = Flesh, Field | 11 o'clock |

### 2.3 Adjacency Relationships

Because the circle of fifths creates natural harmonic relationships, **adjacent roots share semantic affinity:**

| Adjacent Pair | Shared Meaning | Why |
|---|---|---|
| C ↔ G | Self and Others | Identity is formed through connection |
| G ↔ D | People and Action | We act upon each other |
| D ↔ A | Doing and Knowing | Action produces understanding |
| A ↔ E | Mind and Heart | Thought and feeling intertwine |
| E ↔ B | Feeling and Time | Emotions live in time, memories are feelings preserved |
| B ↔ F# | Time and the Unknown | The future is time's unknown territory |
| F# ↔ Db | The Unknown and Boundaries | Where the unknown meets the known, there is a border |
| Db ↔ Ab | Boundaries and Spirit | The edge of the known touches the transcendent |
| Ab ↔ Eb | Spirit and Home | Sacred spaces are where we feel we belong |
| Eb ↔ Bb | Home and Desire | We long for where we belong |
| Bb ↔ F | Desire and Nature | Need is rooted in the body |
| F ↔ C | Nature and Self | The body is the ground of being |

### 2.4 Tritone Oppositions

Notes separated by a **tritone** (6 semitones — the maximum harmonic distance) carry **complementary or opposing** meanings:

| Root | Tritone Partner | Opposition |
|---|---|---|
| C (Self) ↔ F#/Gb (Unknown) | Who I am vs. What I might become |
| G (Connection) ↔ Db (Conflict) | Togetherness vs. Division |
| D (Action) ↔ Ab (Spirit) | The physical act vs. The metaphysical |
| A (Knowledge) ↔ Eb (Home) | What I know vs. Where I belong |
| E (Emotion) ↔ Bb (Desire) | What I feel vs. What I want |
| B (Time) ↔ F (Nature) | Change vs. The eternal physical world |

These oppositions are **productive** — when a tritone appears in a chord or progression, it creates tension between the two opposing domains. The tritone in music is called *diabolus in musica* — the most unstable interval. In Harmonia, it is the sound of **two truths pulling against each other.**

## Chapter 3: Morphology — Chord Qualities as Modifiers

Each root can be **qualified** by the type of chord built upon it. The chord quality functions as an **adjective, adverb, or modal particle** — it changes how the root concept is experienced.

### 3.1 Primary Qualities

| Quality | Interval Structure | Semantic Function | Translation Pattern | Emotional Color |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Major** | 1 – 3 – 5 | Positive, present, affirmed | "[Root], yes" | Bright, stable, resolved |
| **Minor** | 1 – ♭3 – 5 | Negative, absent, reflective | "[Root], no / lost / remembered" | Dark, introspective, melancholy |
| **Dominant 7th** | 1 – 3 – 5 – ♭7 | Question, seeking, tension | "[Root]? / Where is [root]?" | Unstable, searching, needing resolution |
| **Major 7th** | 1 – 3 – 5 – 7 | Wonder, beauty, aspiration | "How beautiful [root] is" | Luminous, open, bittersweet |
| **Minor 7th** | 1 – ♭3 – 5 – ♭7 | Melancholy depth, sustained reflection | "[Root], lingering in absence" | Deep, rich, contemplative |
| **Diminished** | 1 – ♭3 – ♭5 | Danger, warning, hidden threat | "Beware [root]!" | Tense, alarming, unstable |
| **Half-diminished** (m7♭5) | 1 – ♭3 – ♭5 – ♭7 | Dissolving, crumbling, structural failure | "[Root] is collapsing" | Anxious, unsteady, the ground shifting |
| **Augmented** | 1 – 3 – #5 | Excess, intensification, too much | "Too much [root]" / "[Root] overwhelming" | Strange, expansive, unsettling |
| **Sus4** | 1 – 4 – 5 | Anticipation, withholding, not yet | "[Root], waiting / withheld" | Suspended, unresolved, potential |
| **Sus2** | 1 – 2 – 5 | Openness, beginning, undefined | "[Root], open / undefined / becoming" | Airy, spacious, undefined |
| **Power chord** (5th) | 1 – 5 | Raw, imperative, blunt | "[ROOT]!" (command) | Stark, forceful, stripped |
| **Add9** | 1 – 3 – 5 – 9 | Nuance, complexity, added dimension | "[Root], with depth" | Colorful, modern, layered |
| **6th** | 1 – 3 – 5 – 6 | Sweetness preserved within, nostalgia | "[Root], with a memory inside" | Warm, nostalgic, bittersweet |
| **Minor 6th** | 1 – ♭3 – 5 – 6 | Loss containing preserved beauty | "[Root] is gone, but beauty remains" | Poignant, elegiac |

### 3.2 Compound Qualities (Extensions)

Extensions beyond the 7th add **layers of nuance:**

| Extension | Semantic Addition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **9th** | Expanded awareness, wider perspective | Cm9 = "Being, reflected upon, with wider awareness" |
| **♭9** | The darkest coloring — a question that already contains its answer | D7♭9 = "Where am I going? — I already know, and it is dark" |
| **#9** | Distortion, the Hendrix chord — reality warped | E7#9 = "Feeling, questioned, with reality bending" |
| **11th** | Suspension within the extended chord — still waiting | Am11 = "Not-knowing, with suspended action within" |
| **#11** | Lydian brightness — seeing beyond the ordinary | Fmaj7#11 = "Nature, wondrous, seen with extraordinary clarity" |
| **13th** | The fullest possible expression — everything at once | G13 = "Connection in its most complete form" |
| **♭13** | Shadowed completeness — everything present but darkened | A♭13 = "Spirit, everything present, but with shadow" |

### 3.3 Altered Chords

When multiple alterations are combined, the chord becomes **destabilized** — the semantic domain is present but everything around it is shifting:

| Chord | Translation |
|---|---|
| **D7alt** (D7♭9♭13) | "Action — questioned — the darkest answer — shadowed — everything in motion" |
| **E7#9** | "Emotion — questioned — reality distorted around the feeling" |

Altered chords are the vocabulary of **extreme states** — madness, revelation, the moment before transformation. In narrative terms, they are the chords of Don Quixote's vision, of Lear's storm, of any moment when the world as-it-is cracks open.

## Chapter 4: Grammar — The Structure of Sentences

### 4.1 Octave = Tense

| Octave Range | Tense | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Octave 1–2** (very low) | Deep Past | Ancient history, myth, "long ago" |
| **Octave 3** (low) | Past | Recent past, memory, "I was" |
| **Octave 4** (middle) | Present | Now, "I am," the current moment |
| **Octave 5** (high) | Future | What will be, aspiration, "I will" |
| **Octave 6** (very high) | Transcendent / Eternal | Beyond time, always, "forever" |

**Cross-octave movement** within a phrase indicates **temporal shift:**

| Movement | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Low → High | Past → Future = "progression, hope, journey forward" | Hedwig's Theme (octave 4 → 5) |
| High → Low | Future → Past = "falling back, nostalgia, descent" | Autumn Leaves (steady descent through registers) |
| Staying in one octave | Temporal stasis = "stuck in this moment" | Etta James (stays in octave 4 — trapped in the present) |

### 4.2 Inversion = Grammatical Case

| Inversion | Bass Note | Grammatical Function | Notation | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Root position** | Root in bass | **Nominative** — Subject, Agent | C | "The self acts" |
| **1st inversion** | 3rd in bass | **Accusative** — Object, Receiver | C/E | "The self receives" / "upon the self" |
| **2nd inversion** | 5th in bass | **Descriptive** — Modifier, Attribute | C/G | "The self, defined by connection" |

**Advanced inversions (slash chords):**

When a chord is placed over a bass note from a **different domain**, it creates a **compound concept:**

| Slash Chord | Translation | Linguistic Parallel |
|---|---|---|
| C/G | Self over Connection | "Being, grounded in togetherness" |
| E/B | Emotion over Time | "Feeling, carried by time" = memory |
| D/F | Action over Nature | "Doing, rooted in the physical" = labor |
| A/Eb | Knowledge over Home | "Understanding, based in belonging" = tradition |
| G/C | Connection over Self | "Togetherness, centered in being" = intimacy |

### 4.3 Time Signature = Speech Mode

| Time Signature | Speech Mode | Description | Used In |
|---|---|---|---|
| **4/4** | Declarative | Grounded, certain, testimony, prose | Etta James, Donne, ordinary speech |
| **3/4** | Incantation | Circular, enchanted, spellcasting, poetry | Hedwig's Theme, fairy tales |
| **6/8** | Narrative | Flowing, storytelling, epic, ballad | Don Quixote, tales |
| **2/4** | Imperative | Marching, commanding, directing, law | Military, orders, decrees |
| **3/8** | Intimate | Turning, private, trapped in a loop | Für Elise, private confession |
| **5/4** | Unsettled | Limping, asymmetric, something is wrong | Testimony of trauma, alienation |
| **7/8** | Ecstatic / Prophetic | Irregular, driven, beyond ordinary meter | Prophecy, vision, rapture |
| **Free time** | Stream of consciousness | No meter, free association | Dreams, meditation, pure thought |
| **Swing (any meter)** | Retrospective | Leaning backward, remembering, jazz | Autumn Leaves, any nostalgic speech |

### 4.4 Dynamics = Register and Sincerity

| Dynamic | Register | Sincerity Level |
|---|---|---|
| **ppp** | The most intimate possible — thought itself | Absolute sincerity — barely conscious |
| **pp** | Whispered, private, secret | Deep sincerity — a truth told only to the closest |
| **p** | Soft, gentle, personal | Sincere — speaking honestly |
| **mp** | Conversational, comfortable | Normal speech — natural register |
| **mf** | Confident, projected, public | Declarative — speaking to a group |
| **f** | Urgent, emphatic, passionate | Heightened — this matters deeply |
| **ff** | Commanding, overwhelming, shouting | Warning or imperative — LISTEN |
| **fff** | Beyond language — the sound itself is the meaning | Ecstatic or catastrophic — words fail |

**Dynamic Mismatch = Irony** (see Section 4.8)

When the dynamic level does **not match** the content's importance, the mismatch signals irony:

| Mismatch | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Trivial content + loud dynamic | Mock-heroic — treating the small as grand |
| Profound content + soft dynamic | Understatement — the most important thing said quietly |
| Content shifts but dynamic stays flat | Deadpan — the speaker is suppressing reaction |

### 4.5 Tempo = Deliberateness

| Tempo Range | BPM | Speech Quality |
|---|---|---|
| **Largo** | 40–60 | Monumental, ritual, each word weighed against eternity |
| **Adagio** | 60–72 | Contemplative, deliberate, philosophical |
| **Andante** | 72–96 | Walking pace, conversational, natural |
| **Moderato** | 96–112 | Steady, purposeful, narrative |
| **Allegro** | 112–144 | Energetic, excited, urgent |
| **Presto** | 144–180 | Frantic, ecstatic, overwhelmed, out of control |

**Rubato** (flexible tempo) = the speaker pauses when overwhelmed by memory or emotion, then continues. Time becomes unreliable. The past floods in.

**Accelerando** (speeding up) = rising urgency, approaching a climax.

**Ritardando** (slowing down) = arriving at a conclusion, accepting, settling.

### 4.6 Instrumentation = Speaker Identity

| Instrument Family | Speaker | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| **Piano** | The human individual | Personal, vulnerable, capable of both intimacy and power |
| **Strings** | The emotional community | Shared feeling, communal, warmth, grief |
| **Brass** | The heroic / public voice | Authority, power, fanfare, declaration |
| **Woodwinds** | Nature, breath, the pastoral | Organic, breathing, birdsong, wind |
| **Celesta/Glockenspiel** | The otherworldly | Magic, childhood, the supernatural |
| **Harp** | Transition, shimmer | The space between states, the portal |
| **Organ** | The institutional / sacred | Church, law, eternity, the community's voice |
| **Guitar (classical)** | The storyteller / troubadour | Narrative, warm, ironic, human-scale |
| **Guitar (electric)** | The modern individual | Raw, amplified, distorted self |
| **Choir** | Humanity itself | The universal, the collective, all of us |
| **Drum/Percussion** | Time's body | Heartbeat, footsteps, the clock, mortality |
| **Brushes** | Memory's texture | The continuous whisper of the past |
| **Bells/Tubular bells** | Time's voice | Marking moments, announcing, tolling |
| **Solo voice** | The most individual speaker | Irreducible personhood — this one soul |

**Instrument changes within a piece** = changes in speaker or perspective:

| Change | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Solo → Ensemble | Individual → Community | "I" becomes "we" (Hedwig: celesta → strings) |
| Ensemble → Solo | Community → Individual | "We" becomes "I" (Donne: organ → piano at "diminishes ME") |
| One instrument → Different instrument | Change of speaker | Narrator vs. Character (Quixote: guitar vs. oboe) |

### 4.7 Silence = Punctuation, Negation, and the Unsaid

| Type of Silence | Duration | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Short rest** (< 1 beat) | Brief | Comma — a breath, a pause between phrases |
| **Quarter rest** (1 beat) | Moderate | Period — end of a sentence |
| **Half rest** (2 beats) | Longer | Paragraph break — a new thought begins |
| **Full measure rest** | Long | Ellipsis... — something unsaid, trailing off |
| **Multi-measure rest** | Very long | Negation or the unasked question — the most powerful silence |
| **Fermata** (held note → silence) | Variable | The note decays into silence naturally — letting meaning dissolve |
| **Grand Pause (G.P.)** | The entire ensemble stops | The world stops — a rupture in the fabric of speech |

**Silence as Negation:**

In the Donne composition, the rest after the opening Cm IS the word "No." The chord states the false premise; the silence denies it. Silence is not the absence of meaning — it is the presence of a meaning too large or too important for sound.

### 4.8 The Irony Toolkit — Advanced Grammar

Irony is meaning that contradicts its surface. In Harmonia, irony is created through **mismatch** between layers:

| Device | How It Works | Translation | First Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unresolved Suspension** | A sus4 that never resolves to major or minor | "I could tell you, but I won't" | Cervantes: Asus4 (the unnamed town) |
| **Dynamic Mismatch** | Volume doesn't match content importance | "The speaker is performing rather than speaking" | Cervantes: A major played f for "truth" |
| **Grace Note (Acciaccatura)** | A quick crushed note before the chord | "The narrator's wink — I know something you don't" | Cervantes: grace note on "duelos y quebrantos" |
| **Register Mismatch** | A humble subject in a noble register (or vice versa) | "Mock-heroic — treating the mundane as epic" | Cervantes: Fm played high for a thin horse |
| **Quality Mismatch** | Major chord for sad content, minor for happy content | "Dark comedy — the speaker smiles at what should be painful" | Not yet used — available for future texts |
| **Quotation** | Inserting a melodic fragment from another piece | "The speaker is referencing another text/context" | Jazz improvisation: quoting other melodies |

---

## Chapter 5: Syntax — How Chords Form Sentences

### 5.1 The Chord as Word

A single chord in Harmonia is a **word** — but a word that is more like a compressed phrase in a spoken language:

```
Gm7 = G (Connection) + minor (absent) + 7th (melancholy depth)
    = "Connection, lingering in its absence"
    = "The togetherness that is gone, felt deeply"
```

A word in Harmonia carries:
- **Root** = what the word is about (noun/topic)
- **Quality** = how it is experienced (adjective/mood)
- **Extension** = how deeply it is felt (adverb/intensifier)
- **Inversion** = its grammatical role (case)
- **Register** = when it exists (tense)
- **Dynamic** = how it is spoken (register/sincerity)

### 5.2 Two-Chord Phrases

The smallest meaningful sentence in Harmonia is **two chords** — because meaning emerges from **relationship.**

| Phrase Type | Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Statement** | X → Y (any progression) | "[X] leads to [Y]" | C → G = "Self leads to Connection" |
| **Question** | X → X7 | "[X] questions itself" | A → A7 = "Knowledge questions itself" |
| **Negation** | X → (silence) | "[X] — No." | Cm → (rest) = "Self alone — No." (Donne) |
| **Transformation** | X major → X minor | "[X] changes polarity" | F → Fm = "Nature whole → Nature eroded" |
| **Compound word** | X → Y (no rest between) | "[X]-[Y]" (a compound concept) | Em → Bb = "Missing-wanting" = Regret |
| **Opposition** | X → tritone of X | "[X] confronts its opposite" | C → F# = "Self confronts the Unknown" |

### 5.3 Cadences = Sentence Endings

Musical cadences — the ways phrases end — function as **sentence types:**

| Cadence | Chords | Sentence Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Perfect Authentic (V → I)** | D → G (in key of G) | Declarative — a statement completed | "This is true. Period." |
| **Plagal (IV → I)** | C → G (in key of G) | Benediction — a blessing, an affirmation | "So be it." / "Amen." |
| **Imperfect (I → V)** | G → D (in key of G) | Incomplete — pointing outward | "And then..." / "Which leads to..." |
| **Deceptive (V → vi)** | D → Em (in key of G) | Surprise — expectation subverted | "You expected X, but Y is true" |
| **Half Cadence (→ V)** | Any → D (in key of G) | Question — unresolved, hanging | "But what about...?" |
| **No cadence (→ sus4)** | Any → Xsus4 | Deliberately unresolved — withholding | "I won't tell you." (Cervantes) |

### 5.4 Progressions as Paragraphs

Longer chord progressions function as **paragraphs** — sustained arguments, narratives, or meditations:

| Progression Type | Harmonic Pattern | Narrative Function | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Circle of fifths descent** | Each root falls by a 5th | Inevitable decline, gravity, grief | Autumn Leaves: Cm7→F7→B♭maj7→E♭maj7→Am7♭5→D7→Gm |
| **Ascending by step** | Each root rises by a whole or half step | Growth, rising action, hope | — |
| **Oscillation** | Two chords alternating | Trapped, circling, obsession | Für Elise: Am ↔ E; Etta James: A ↔ Bm |
| **Parallel major/minor** | Same roots, alternating major/minor | Duality, seeing both sides, irony | Quixote: F → Fm → F → Fmaj7 |
| **Chromatic descent** | Roots descend by half steps | Slow dissolution, entropy | — |
| **Modal plateau** | Same chord, repeated | Stasis, inventory, the unchanging | Quixote: G → G → G (three people, plain) |
| **Key change (modulation)** | Shift to a new tonic | Fundamental change of subject/perspective | Autumn Leaves: B♭ major → G minor |

### 5.5 Key Signature as Context

The **key** of a Harmonia composition sets the **domain of the entire conversation** — the topic, the frame, the worldview from which everything is spoken:

| Element | Function | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Root of key** | The primary subject | Key of G = "This is about Connection" |
| **Quality of key** | The stance toward that subject | G minor = "Connection, lost" (Autumn Leaves) vs. G major = "Connection, affirmed" (Donne) |
| **Foreign notes** | Notes outside the key = foreign concepts, intruders, revelations | D# in E minor (Hedwig) = "Home" appearing as a foreign note — home doesn't belong in this reality |

### 5.6 Modulation as Topic Change

When a piece **modulates** (changes key), the conversation changes subject:

| Modulation Type | Method | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **To relative major/minor** | Em → G or G → Em | Shifting between two aspects of the same truth (feeling vs. connection) |
| **To dominant** | G → D | "Because of connection, action follows" — natural consequence |
| **To subdominant** | G → C | "Connection is grounded in self" — seeking the foundation |
| **To parallel major/minor** | Gm → G or G → Gm | "The same subject, seen from the other side" — Autumn Leaves does this every 8 bars |
| **To distant key** | G → Db | "The subject changes radically" — a rupture, a revelation, a new world |
| **Pivot chord modulation** | A chord shared by both keys | "These two subjects are connected through [pivot chord]" |

---

## Chapter 6: Aspect and Mood — Rhythm and Articulation

### 6.1 Rhythmic Aspect

How a chord is **rhythmically delivered** encodes verbal **aspect** (the shape of the action in time):

| Rhythmic Delivery | Aspect | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Sustained (long hold)** | Stative — a condition, not an action | "It IS [chord]" — being, not doing |
| **Repeated (pulsing)** | Habitual / Imperfect — ongoing, repeated | "It keeps [chord]-ing" — the wheel of meals in Quixote |
| **Single strike** | Perfective — completed, punctual | "It [chord]-ed" — done, finished |
| **Arpeggiated (rolled)** | Process — unfolding, revealing itself | "It is becoming [chord]" — the idea unfolds |
| **Syncopated (off-beat)** | Emphatic / Unexpected | "ACTUALLY, [chord]" — stressed, surprising |
| **Staccato (short, detached)** | Abrupt, clipped, matter-of-fact | "[chord]. Period." — no elaboration |
| **Legato (smooth, connected)** | Flowing, continuous | "[chord] flows into..." — narrative connection |
| **Tremolo (rapid repetition)** | Anxiety, intensity, approaching | "[chord] is imminent / overwhelming" |

### 6.2 Articulation as Mood

| Articulation | Grammatical Mood | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Legato** | Indicative — stating facts | "This is what happened" |
| **Staccato** | Imperative — giving commands | "Do this!" |
| **Marcato (accented)** | Emphatic — insisting | "THIS is important" |
| **Tenuto (held full value)** | Contemplative — weighing each word | "Consider this..." |
| **Sforzando (sudden accent)** | Exclamatory | "Look!" / "Listen!" |
| **Grace notes** | Subjunctive / Ironic | "Supposedly..." / (wink) |
| **Portamento (slide)** | Conditional — "if" | "If [chord] were to..." |

# PART II: THE DICTIONARY

## Chapter 7: Complete Word List (Core Vocabulary)

### 7.1 The 120 Base Words

Every combination of 12 roots × 10 primary qualities yields the core vocabulary. Here are the most important entries:

#### C — Being, Self

| Chord | Translation | Notes |

# PART III: SOLVING THE TEXT-TO-MUSIC PROBLEM

## Chapter 8: Melodic Templates — Making Text Sing

You noticed that the text-to-chord compositions (Donne, Cervantes) sound **rougher** than the music-to-text translations. The reason is clear: spoken language has **rhetorical rhythm** (stressed/unstressed syllables, sentence arc), while music has **phrase rhythm** (melodic contour, regular groupings). When we translate text to chords without melody, we get harmonic skeletons without flesh.

The solution: **Melodic Templates** — standard melodic patterns that can be applied to any chord progression to create flowing, singable music.

### 8.1 Sentence Contour Templates

Every sentence in a spoken language has a **pitch contour** — it rises, falls, peaks, and resolves. Harmonia formalizes this:

| Sentence Type | Contour Shape | Description | Template |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Declarative** | Arc (rise → peak → fall) | States a fact | Rise to the 3rd or 5th measure, then descend to tonic |
| **Interrogative** | Rise (low → high, no descent) | Asks a question | Ascend throughout, end on the 5th or 7th (unresolved) |
| **Imperative** | Flat → Sharp descent | Gives a command | Stay on one pitch, then drop sharply |
| **Exclamatory** | Leap up → Sustain | Expresses surprise/intensity | Large upward interval, then held note |
| **Reflective** | Gentle undulation, low range | Contemplates | Small intervals, stepwise motion, middle-low register |
| **Narrative** | Long arc with internal waves | Tells a story | Multiple small arcs within one large arc |

### 8.2 The Basic Melodic Algorithm

For any chord in the progression, the melody note is selected by:

```
1. Choose a note FROM the chord (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th)
2. Apply the sentence contour template (rising, falling, arcing)
3. Connect to the next chord's melody note by the SMALLEST possible interval
4. On the most important word, use the HIGHEST or LOWEST note in the phrase
```

#### Rule 1: Voice Leading

The melody should move by **steps** (1–2 semitones) or **small leaps** (3–4 semitones) between chords. Large leaps (5+ semitones) are reserved for **moments of revelation or emphasis.**

| Movement | Interval | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Half step (1 semitone) | The smallest possible change | "Almost the same — barely different — the thinnest wall" |
| Whole step (2 semitones) | Natural, stepwise | "Flowing, natural, conversational" |
| Minor 3rd (3 semitones) | Small leap | "Gentle reaching — tender" |
| Major 3rd (4 semitones) | Medium leap | "Confident reaching — affirmative" |
| Perfect 4th (5 semitones) | Open, natural | "A question opening" |
| Perfect 5th (7 semitones) | Wide, expansive | "Breathless wonder" (the Hedwig leap) |
| Octave (12 semitones) | The maximum leap | "Transformation — the same thing, in a new world" |

#### Rule 2: Phrase Grouping

Group chords into **phrases of 4** (or 3, or 2) — matching the natural grouping of both music and rhetoric:

```
4-chord phrase: [Setup] → [Development] → [Climax] → [Resolution]
                   I          ii/IV           V           I
              "This is"    "which leads"   "to THIS"   "therefore."
```

#### Rule 3: The Melodic Arc

Within each 4-chord phrase, the melody should follow one of these standard arcs:

**Arc Type A — The Statement:**
```
Melody:    ·  ·
          ·    ·
         ·      ·
        ·        ·
Chord:  1   2   3   4
```
Rises gently, peaks at chord 3, descends to resolution.

**Arc Type B — The Question:**
```
Melody:            ·
                  ·
                ·
         ·  ·
        ·
Chord:  1   2   3   4
```
Stays low, then rises sharply — ends high, unresolved.

**Arc Type C — The Revelation:**
```
Melody: ·
         ·
          ·
           ·  ·  ·
Chord:  1   2   3   4
```
Starts high (the claim), descends (the evidence), sustains (the truth settles).

**Arc Type D — The Narrative:**
```
Melody:    ·        ·
          · ·      · ·
         ·   ·    ·   ·
        ·     ·  ·     ·
Chord:  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
```
Multiple small waves within a larger arc — storytelling rhythm.

### 8.3 Connecting Tissue — Passing Tones and Transitions

Between chords, add **passing notes** that bridge the gap:

| Transition Type | Technique | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Stepwise passing tone** | Fill in the gap between chord tones with scale notes | Default — smooth, natural |
| **Chromatic approach** | Approach the next chord tone from a half step below | Before important moments — "arriving with intention" |
| **Anticipation** | Play the next chord's note before the chord change | Eagerness, forward momentum — "rushing toward" |
| **Suspension** | Hold the previous chord's note over the new chord, then resolve | Reluctance, lingering — "not yet ready to let go" |
| **Silence** | Rest between chords | Weight, separation — "these are distinct thoughts" |

### 8.4 Applied Example: The Donne Opening, With Melody

Original (chords only):
```
Cm → (rest) → G → Gmaj7 → Fmaj7 → C
```

With melody applied (using Arc Type C — Revelation):

```
Melody:    Eb5   (rest)   D5    D5     C5      C5
              ↓              ↓     ↓      ↓       ↓
Chord:     Cm    (rest)    G    Gmaj7  Fmaj7    C

Contour:   High            ← descending by steps →  Low
           (the claim)      (the evidence settles)   (resolution)

Passing:         rest    D5→    D5→     C5→      C5
                        (held) (same)  (step ↓)  (arrived)
```

The melody starts on **Eb5** (the ♭3 of Cm — the note of absence) and descends stepwise through **D5** (the root of G — connection) to **C5** (the root of C — self). The melody literally **walks from absence to presence**, from the island to the continent.

Add a **bass line** following the chord roots:

```
Bass:      C3    (rest)   G2     G2      F2      C3
```

The bass descends (C→G→F) and then returns to C — the physical path from self, outward through the world, and back to self-in-connection.

Now the same passage has **three layers of meaning sounding simultaneously:**
1. **Harmony** (chords) = the semantic content
2. **Melody** (top voice) = the emotional arc
3. **Bass** (bottom voice) = the physical journey

This is polyphonic speech — multiple meanings at once. What no spoken language can do.

### 8.5 Rhythmic Templates for Different Text Types

| Text Type | Rhythmic Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Poetry (metered)** | Regular rhythmic groupings matching the poetic meter | The music's rhythm mirrors the verse's rhythm |
| **Poetry (free verse)** | Irregular groupings, rubato | The music breathes with the line breaks |
| **Prose (declarative)** | Steady quarter notes, minimal syncopation | Even, measured, the rhythm of testimony |
| **Prose (narrative)** | 6/8 lilt, flowing eighths | The trotting pace of storytelling |
| **Dialogue** | Call and response between instruments | Each speaker gets their own timbre |
| **Interior monologue** | Single instrument, rubato, fragments | Thought doesn't flow evenly — it stutters and surges |
| **List / Inventory** | Ostinato (repeating pattern) | Each item in the list gets the same rhythmic cell |

# PART IV: WRITING SYSTEM

## Chapter 9: Harmonia Notation

### 9.1 Standard Notation (for musicians)

Harmonia can be written using standard Western musical notation — treble and bass clef, with chord symbols above:

```
    Gm7         Cmaj7        D7          Gsus4 → G
  ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬──────────────┐
  │ ♭ ♭       │           │   ♭       │              │
  │ d  b      │ e    b    │ c   a     │  d  c    d   │
  │    g      │      g    │      f#   │     b    b   │
  │           │    e      │           │              │
  └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴──────────────┘
  "Together-  "I am,      "Where am   "About to
   ness,      and it is   I going?"    connect...
   lingering   wondrous"               connected."
   in loss"
```

### 9.2 Chord-Symbol Notation (for quick writing)

For rapid composition, a shorthand system using just chord symbols, dynamics, and annotations:

```
[Key: Gm | Time: 4/4 swing | Tempo: ♩=72 | Voice: Solo Trumpet]

Cm7(mp) → F7(mp) → B♭maj7(mf↑) → E♭maj7(mf)
"I was" → "the world asked" → "wanting was beautiful" → "belonging was wondrous"

Am7♭5(f↓) → D7(f) → Gm6(mp)
"understanding crumbles" → "where am I falling?" → "gone... but sweet"
```

### 9.3 Semantic Notation (for non-musicians)

A notation system that foregrounds meaning rather than sound:

```
DOMAIN:quality(dynamic)[octave]{articulation}

Example:
BEING:wonder(soft)[present]{sustained} = Cmaj7, mp, octave 4, held
CONNECTION:absent(loud)[past]{struck} = Gm, f, octave 3, staccato
ACTION:imperative(very loud)[present]{blunt} = D5, ff, octave 4, marcato
```

### 9.4 Visual Notation — The Harmonia Circle

For visual thinkers, a circular diagram where:
- **Position** on the circle = root (semantic domain)
- **Color** = quality (warm colors = major, cool colors = minor)
- **Size** = dynamic (larger = louder)
- **Ring** (inner/outer) = octave (inner = low/past, outer = high/future)

This allows an entire composition to be visualized as a **path through colored space** — a kind of semantic map you can read at a glance.

# PART V: COMPOSITION GUIDE

## Chapter 10: How to Compose in Harmonia

### 10.1 Text-to-Music Process (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Identify the Domain**
What is the text fundamentally about? This determines the **key.**

| If the text is about... | Key root | Major or minor? |
|---|---|---|
| Self, identity | C | Major if affirmed, minor if in crisis |
| Relationships, community | G | Major if together, minor if apart |
| Journeys, quests, work | D | Major if active, minor if stalled |
| Truth, learning, memory | A | Major if clear, minor if confused |
| Love, grief, passion | E | Major if joyful, minor if sorrowful |
| Time, aging, seasons | B | Major if present, minor if past |
| The unknown, possibility | F# | Major if exciting, minor if frightening |
| Conflict, boundaries | Db | Major if defined, minor if collapsed |
| Faith, spirituality | Ab | Major if present, minor if lost |
| Home, belonging | Eb | Major if safe, minor if exiled |
| Longing, hope, dreams | Bb | Major if hopeful, minor if refused |
| Nature, the body, reality | F | Major if whole, minor if eroded |

**Step 2: Choose the Speech Mode**
What kind of text is this? This determines the **time signature.**

**Step 3: Map Key Concepts to Roots**
Go through the text and identify the most important concepts. Assign each to a Harmonia root.

**Step 4: Choose Chord Qualities**
For each concept, determine its polarity and depth. Is it affirmed or denied? Questioned or answered? Wondrous or dangerous?

**Step 5: Determine Inversions**
Which concepts are subjects (root position)? Which are objects (1st inversion)? Which are modifiers (2nd inversion)?

**Step 6: Set Dynamics**
How loudly is each idea spoken? Does the piece build? Withdraw? Where is the climax?

**Step 7: Apply a Melodic Template**
Choose a sentence contour (arc, question, revelation, narrative) and apply it to the chord progression using the voice-leading rules.

**Step 8: Add Passing Tones and Transitions**
Smooth the connections between chords using steps, approaches, suspensions, or rests.

**Step 9: Choose Instrumentation**
Who is speaking? How many voices? When do they enter and exit?

**Step 10: Review for Musical Naturalness**
Play the result. Does it flow? Do the voice leading and harmonic gravity feel natural? Adjust as needed.

### 10.2 Music-to-Text Process (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Identify the Key**
What domain is the piece speaking from? Major or minor?

**Step 2: Map the Chord Roots**
List every chord and its root. Translate each root to its semantic domain.

**Step 3: Read the Chord Qualities**
Is each chord major, minor, dominant, suspended? Apply the quality modifier.

**Step 4: Note the Dynamics**
Where is the piece loud? Soft? What does the volume tell you about intimacy and urgency?

**Step 5: Track the Melody's Intervals**
What are the distances between notes? Steps = natural flow. Leaps = moments of revelation.

**Step 6: Listen for Silence**
Where are the rests? What is NOT being said?

**Step 7: Identify the Cadences**
How do phrases end? Resolved (statement)? Unresolved (question)? Deceptive (surprise)?

**Step 8: Assemble the Translation**
Build the text by reading each chord as a word, each progression as a sentence, each section as a paragraph.
