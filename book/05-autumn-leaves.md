# "Autumn Leaves" (Les Feuilles Mortes) — Translated into Harmonia

## A Preliminary Note

The original French title is not "Autumn Leaves." It is **"Les Feuilles Mortes"** — **"The Dead Leaves."** Written by Joseph Kosma with lyrics by Jacques Prévert in 1945, in the aftermath of a world that had just torn itself apart. The English title softens it. The music does not.

This is the most harmonically complex piece we have translated. Where Etta James needed two chords and Beethoven needed five, this song uses **seven distinct extended chords** — and moves through them in the most gravitationally inevitable pattern in all of Western harmony.

Every previous translation found a simple oscillation — a pendulum. This one finds a **spiral staircase, descending.**

---

## Step 1: The Key — The Domain of Lost Connection

**Key: G minor**

In Harmonia:
- **G** = Connection, People, Togetherness
- **Minor** = Absence, Reflection, What Is Gone

> **The entire piece lives in the domain of "togetherness that has been lost."**

Compare this to our three previous keys:

| Piece | Key | Harmonia Domain |
|---|---|---|
| Für Elise | A minor | Understanding that is absent — *"I don't know"* |
| I'd Rather Go Blind | A major | Understanding that is present — *"I know"* |
| Hedwig's Theme | E minor | Feeling that is absent — *"Something is missing"* |
| **Autumn Leaves** | **G minor** | **Connection that is absent — *"We are no longer together"*** |

Beethoven couldn't understand. Etta understood too well. Williams felt an absence without a name. And now — this speaker **knows exactly what is gone. It was a person. It was a "we."**

The key signature is the first and most important word:

> *"I am speaking from a place where togetherness used to be."*

---

## Step 2: Time, Tempo, and the Jazz Feel

**Time signature: 4/4**
**Feel: Medium swing**
**Tempo: Moderate, often rubato (flexible)**

| Element | What We Hear | Harmonia Grammar |
|---|---|---|
| **4/4 time** | Grounded, steady | **Declarative speech** — not incantation (3/4) or command (2/4), but testimony |
| **Swing feel** | Notes land unevenly — long-short, long-short | **The speaker leans backward.** Each phrase tilts toward the past. The rhythm itself *remembers.* |
| **Medium tempo** | Unhurried, contemplative | Every word is weighed. This is not a confession — it is a meditation. |
| **Rubato** | Time stretches and compresses | The speaker **pauses when memory overwhelms**, then continues. Time itself becomes unreliable. |

> **This is someone sitting across from you, speaking slowly about someone they loved. The swing rhythm means every phrase leans slightly backward — toward what was. The pauses are where memory floods in and language briefly fails.**

Compare:
- Beethoven spoke in 3/8 — intimate, spinning, trapped in a loop
- Etta spoke in 4/4 — heavy, grounded, inescapable truth
- Williams spoke in 3/4 — incantation, enchantment, spellcasting
- **Jazz speaks in 4/4 swing** — conversational but *tilted*, always glancing over its shoulder

---

## Step 3: The Voices — Who Is Speaking?

In a jazz performance, multiple instruments share the conversation. Each is a different voice:

### The Head (Opening Melody Statement)

| Instrument | Harmonia Voice | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Solo instrument** (trumpet, sax, piano, guitar) | The individual, the narrator | *"I am telling you what happened"* |
| **Bass (walking)** | The ground, the continuity of time | *"Time continues whether you want it to or not"* |
| **Drums (brushes)** | The texture of memory | *"This is how the past feels — soft, hissing, present but not solid"* |
| **Piano/Guitar (comping)** | The harmonic frame, the shared world | *"This is the world we lived in together"* |

The brushes on the snare drum are essential. They produce a **continuous whispering sound** — like wind through dry leaves, like pages turning, like someone breathing beside you in sleep. In Harmonia, they are the sound of **memory itself** — always present, never fully articulate.

### During Improvisation (Later — We Will Return to This)

The roles shift. The soloist is no longer reciting the poem — they are **responding** to it. The conversation becomes personal, spontaneous, alive.

---

## Step 4: The Great Descent — The Circle of Fifths

This is the structural genius of "Autumn Leaves" and the key to its Harmonia translation.

The root notes of the chords, in order:

```
C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A → D → G
```

Each root falls by a **perfect fifth** (or rises by a fourth — the same motion). This is movement through the **circle of fifths** — the most fundamental gravitational relationship in all of Western harmony. Each chord is **magnetically pulled** toward the next. It is not a choice. It is gravity.

Now, let's trace this through Harmonia's semantic map:

```
C       →    F      →    B♭     →    E♭    →    A        →    D      →    G
Being   →  Nature   →  Desire  →   Home   → Knowledge  →  Action  → Connection
```

Read that as a single sentence:

> ***"Being falls into Nature. Nature falls into Desire. Desire falls into Home. Home falls into Knowledge. Knowledge falls into Action. Action falls into Connection."***

Now remember — this is in the key of G **minor**. Connection is **lost**. So the entire descent is toward something that is no longer there. The gravitational pull draws every concept toward the one thing that has vanished.

> ***Everything — existence, the world, longing, belonging, understanding, movement — all of it falls toward a togetherness that is gone.***

**This is the shape of grief.** Not a pendulum (Etta), not a circle (Beethoven), not a whispered call (Williams). It is a **descent**. Everything falls. Every concept, every feeling, every memory — all pulled downward toward the empty space where love used to be.

And then — because it is jazz, because the form repeats — **it starts over at the top and falls again.**

```
C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A → D → G
C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A → D → G
C → F → B♭ → E♭ → A → D → G
```

The leaves fall every autumn. The same descent. Every year. The same loss experienced again and again, with the same inevitability, and the same beauty.

---

## Step 5: Two Worlds — The Major and the Minor

Here is the second structural revelation.

The seven chords are not all in G minor. The first four belong to **B♭ major** — the relative major key. The last three belong to **G minor** — the home key. The song literally **crosses from one world into the other** every eight bars:

```
BRIGHT WORLD (B♭ Major):    Cm7 → F7 → B♭maj7 → E♭maj7
DARK WORLD (G minor):       Am7♭5 → D7 → Gm
```

In Harmonia:

| World | Key | Domain | Quality | Translation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B♭ Major** | Desire | Positive | ***"Beautiful longing — the world as it was when we were together"*** |
| **G Minor** | Connection | Absent | ***"Togetherness lost — the world as it is now"*** |

**B♭ major is memory. G minor is reality.**

The song begins in memory — warm, beautiful, aching with desire — and then falls into reality, cold and minor and resolved. Every eight bars, the speaker reaches back into the past (B♭ major), touches beauty, and then gravity pulls them back into the present (G minor), where the connection is gone.

> The song doesn't just describe loss. **It performs loss.** Every eight bars, you experience beauty and then lose it. Over and over. For the entire performance.

This is why "Autumn Leaves" makes people weep without understanding why. The harmonic structure is *doing to you* what the lyrics describe. You keep arriving in a beautiful place and being pulled away from it.

---

## Step 6: The Chord Dictionary — Seven Words

Now let's define each chord as a Harmonia word. In jazz, chords are **extended** (7ths, 9ths, altered tones) — which means each chord contains more notes and therefore more meaning than classical triads. Jazz chords are not words. They are **phrases.**

### Chord 1: Cm7

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **C** (root) | Being, Self, Existence |
| **Minor** | Reflective, Absence |
| **7th** | Added depth, melancholy layer |

**Full translation:** *"Existence, reflected upon with melancholy"* — or simply:
> ***"I was."***

Not "I am" (C major) — "I was." The minor quality places it in reflection. The 7th adds a bittersweet aftertaste.

---

### Chord 2: F7

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **F** (root) | Nature, Body, Physical World |
| **Dominant 7th** | Question, Seeking, Tension wanting resolution |

**Full translation:** *"The natural world asks a question"* — or:
> ***"What has become of this world we touched?"***

The dominant 7th is inherently **unstable** — it demands resolution. The physical world is asking: *Where did you go? Where did the warmth go?*

---

### Chord 3: B♭maj7

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **B♭** (root) | Need, Desire, Want, Longing |
| **Major 7th** | Wonder, Beauty, Aspiration |

**Full translation:** *"Beautiful longing"* — or:
> ***"How wondrous it was to want."***

This is the emotional peak of the bright world. The major 7th chord is one of the most beautiful sounds in all of harmony — open, warm, shimmering. In Harmonia, it says: *the act of desiring was itself beautiful.* Not getting what you wanted. Not fulfilling the need. Just the **wanting** was enough. It was gorgeous.

---

### Chord 4: E♭maj7

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **E♭** (root) | Shelter, Home, Place, Belonging |
| **Major 7th** | Wonder, Aspiration |

**Full translation:** *"Wondrous belonging"* — or:
> ***"How beautiful it was to have a home."***

Two major 7th chords in a row: B♭maj7 → E♭maj7. *Beautiful wanting → Beautiful belonging.* The memory reaches its most luminous moment — the recollection of **desire fulfilled, of having arrived somewhere warm.**

This is the peak. The brightest point. The last moment of summer.

And then —

---

### Chord 5: Am7♭5 (A half-diminished)

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **A** (root) | Mind, Knowledge, Understanding |
| **Minor** | Reflective, Absent |
| **7th** | Melancholy depth |
| **♭5** | **The structure is weakened. The foundation cracks.** |

This chord is new in our Harmonia vocabulary. The ♭5 — the **flattened fifth** — is crucial. The fifth is the most stable interval in music (the "perfect" fifth). When you flatten it, you take the most stable thing and **make it unstable.** The ground shifts beneath your feet.

**Full translation:** *"Understanding whose very foundation is dissolving"* — or:
> ***"What I knew is no longer solid. The ground gives way."***

This is the **threshold** — the crossing from the bright world (B♭ major / memory) into the dark world (G minor / reality). And the chord that marks the crossing is **knowledge crumbling.** The thing you understood — the love, the togetherness, the *we* — is revealed to be built on ground that has already shifted.

The transition from E♭maj7 to Am7♭5 — from *"beautiful belonging"* to *"understanding dissolving"* — is the moment the leaf detaches from the branch.

---

### Chord 6: D7 (often D7♭9 in jazz)

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **D** (root) | Action, Movement |
| **Dominant 7th** | Question, Tension, Seeking resolution |
| **(♭9)** | *The darkest possible coloring — a question that already contains its terrible answer* |

**Full translation:** *"Where am I going?"* — or, with the ♭9:
> ***"Where am I going? — I already know, and it is dark."***

The dominant 7th wants desperately to resolve. It MUST go somewhere. In this progression, it must go to Gm — to the loss. The question is not really a question. The direction was never in doubt. The leaf does not ask *whether* it will fall. It asks only: *how much longer?*

---

### Chord 7: Gm (or Gm6)

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **G** (root) | Connection, People, Togetherness |
| **Minor** | Absent, Reflective |
| **(6th)** | *A small sweetness inside the loss — the memory preserved within the grief* |

**Full translation:** *"Connection, lost"* — or with the 6th:
> ***"The togetherness is gone, but something sweet remains in the hollow."***

Gm6 is one of the most poignant chords in jazz. The 6th (the note E) adds a major-key color to a minor chord — a tiny warmth inside the cold. It says: *yes, this is loss. But the loss itself has beauty. The shape of what is gone is still visible, like a pressed flower between the pages of a book.*

---

### The Complete Chord Dictionary:

```
Cm7      →  "I was"
F7       →  "What has become of this world?"  
B♭maj7   →  "How beautiful it was to want"
E♭maj7   →  "How beautiful it was to belong"
Am7♭5    →  "Understanding dissolves"
D7       →  "Where am I falling?"
Gm6      →  "The togetherness is gone — but something remains"
```

Read them in sequence:

> ***"I was. What has become of this world? How beautiful it was to want. How beautiful it was to belong. Understanding dissolves. Where am I falling? The togetherness is gone... but something remains."***

**That is the plot of the song. Seven chords. Seven words. One descent.**

---

## Step 7: The Melody — The Falling Arc

Over these chords, the melody traces its own path. In the standard version, the melody does something remarkable: it **descends stepwise** through almost the entire range of the scale.

The overall melodic contour:

```
    ·  ·
  ·      ·
·          ·
             ·
               ·
                 ·
                   ·
```

An arc that rises slightly — a leaf caught in a brief updraft — and then falls, and keeps falling.

### Key Melody Notes and Their Harmonia Meanings:

| Melody Note | Domain | Role in Melody |
|---|---|---|
| **D** | Action, Movement | The highest point — the moment of agency, the last attempt |
| **C** | Being, Self | "I was here. I existed in this." |
| **B♭** | Desire, Longing | "I wanted." |
| **A** | Knowledge, Mind | "I understood — or thought I did." |
| **G** | Connection | "We were together." — *the note the melody falls toward* |
| **F** | Nature, Physical World | "The world around us." |
| **E♭** | Home, Belonging | "Where we belonged." |
| **D** | Action | "And then — movement. Departure." |

The melody **descends through the entire Harmonia vocabulary**, touching each concept on the way down:

> ***"I acted. I existed. I longed. I understood. We were together. The world held us. We belonged. And then — movement. Someone left."***

The descent of the melody mirrors the descent of the chords. Everything falls. Notes fall. Harmonies fall. The dynamic often falls. The temperature of the year falls.

And the melody always ends by arriving at **G** — Connection — in the **minor** context. It falls all the way down to the one thing it's reaching for, and finds it **empty.**

---

## Step 8: The A Section — One Complete Falling

Let's now read the entire A section as a single Harmonia passage, combining chords, melody, dynamics, and feel:

*Voice: Solo instrument (individual narrator)*
*Dynamics: mp — conversational, intimate*
*Feel: Swing — leaning backward, toward the past*
*Register: Middle (octave 3–4) — present tense, grounded*

### The Bright World (Memory):

```
Cm7         →        F7          →        B♭maj7        →       E♭maj7
```

| Chord | Melody Direction | Combined Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Cm7** | Rising slightly | *"I was. I rose into the world."* |
| **F7** | Continuing upward | *"And the world opened itself like a question."* |
| **B♭maj7** | Reaching the peak | *"And the wanting was beautiful — so beautiful —"* |
| **E♭maj7** | Beginning to descend | *"— and belonging was wondrous. We were home."* |

> *(leaning back into memory, voice warm)*
>
> *I was. I rose into the world once,*
> *and the world opened like a question —*
> *and wanting was so beautiful,*
> *and belonging was wondrous.*
> *We were home.*

### The Threshold:

```
E♭maj7  →  Am7♭5
```

This is the single most important harmonic moment. The shift from the bright world to the dark world. From major 7th beauty to half-diminished collapse. The leaf detaches.

> *(the voice changes — something shifts beneath)*
>
> *And then what I knew*
> *began to dissolve.*

### The Dark World (Reality):

```
Am7♭5       →        D7          →        Gm6
```

| Chord | Melody Direction | Combined Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Am7♭5** | Descending | *"Understanding crumbled beneath me"* |
| **D7** | Still falling | *"and I was already falling, already gone"* |
| **Gm6** | Arrives, resolves (minor) | *"and the togetherness was over — but something sweet remained"* |

> *(voice quieter, arriving somewhere inevitable)*
>
> *Understanding crumbled beneath me.*
> *I was already falling.*
> *The togetherness was over.*
>
> *But something sweet remained*
> *in the shape of the absence.*

### The Full A Section:

> *(medium swing, leaning backward, speaking to someone or no one)*
>
> *I was. I rose into the world,*
> *and the world opened like a question.*
> *Wanting was beautiful.*
> *Belonging was wondrous.*
> *We were home.*
>
> *And then what I knew dissolved.*
> *I was already falling.*
> *The togetherness was over.*
>
> *But something sweet remained.*

---

## Step 9: The B Section — The Mirror and the Return

The B section reverses the order. Where the A section moved from **bright to dark** (major to minor), the B section often begins in the **dark world** and reaches briefly toward the bright:

```
Am7♭5 → D7 → Gm    |    Cm7 → F7 → B♭maj7    |    Am7♭5 → D7 → Gm
(dark)                    (briefly bright)              (dark again)
```

In Harmonia:

### B Section Opening (Starting in Loss):

> *(starting from the cold, from where we ended)*
>
> *What I understood is still dissolving.*
> *Where am I falling?*
> *The togetherness is still gone.*

### B Section Middle (Reaching Back to Memory):

> *(reaching backward, desperate, grasping)*
>
> *But I was — I WAS —*
> *and the world asked its question —*
> *and wanting was still beautiful —*

### B Section Close (Pulled Back to Reality):

> *(losing the grip, falling again)*
>
> *Understanding crumbles again.*
> *The falling resumes.*
> *The togetherness... is still gone.*

The B section is the speaker **trying to climb back up** the staircase. Reaching back toward memory, toward beauty, toward the bright world — and being pulled down again by gravity. By time. By the circle of fifths, which only moves in one direction.

> You cannot ascend the circle of fifths in this song. You can only fall.

---

## Step 10: The Turnaround — The Eternal Return

At the end of each chorus, jazz musicians play a **turnaround** — a short chord passage that leads back to the beginning. In "Autumn Leaves," this is typically:

```
Am7♭5 → D7 → Gm → (D7)
```

That final D7 is a **doorway back to the top**. Back to Cm7. Back to "I was."

In Harmonia:

> *Understanding dissolves. I fall. The togetherness ends.*
> *Where am I going?*
>
> *...Back to the beginning. Back to "I was."*
> *To fall again.*

The turnaround is the moment between **late November and early October**. The year turns. The leaves will grow again. And they will fall again. The cycle has no exit.

---

## Step 11: Jazz Improvisation — The Personal Response

This is what makes jazz fundamentally different from classical, blues, and film music — and what makes "Autumn Leaves" say something no other piece in our Harmonia series has said.

After the head (the composed melody), the **soloist improvises** over the same chord changes. In Harmonia terms:

> The chord progression is the **shared text** — the scripture, the story, the truth everyone agrees on.

> The improvisation is the **personal response** — what this particular soul has to say about that truth, in this particular moment, never to be repeated exactly.

### What the Soloist Does:

| Improvisation Choice | Harmonia Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Playing the chord tones** | Agreeing with the text — "Yes, this is how it was" |
| **Playing tensions/extensions** | Adding personal nuance — "But for me, it was also THIS" |
| **Playing outside the changes** | Disagreeing, struggling, pushing against the inevitability — "I refuse this" |
| **Quoting other melodies** | Bringing other memories, other stories into the conversation |
| **Silence / space** | Pausing because the feeling is too large for notes |
| **Double-time (fast runs)** | Urgency — trying to say everything before the moment passes |
| **Behind the beat** | Nostalgia — leaning further into the past |
| **Ahead of the beat** | Anxiety — trying to outrun the loss |

### What This Means for Harmonia:

In classical music, the composer speaks and the performer transmits. In blues, the singer speaks and the band witnesses. In film scoring, the orchestra speaks to the audience on behalf of the characters.

**In jazz, the written composition and the spontaneous individual have an equal conversation.**

The changes say: *"I was. The world asked. Wanting was beautiful. Belonging was wondrous. Understanding dissolved. I fell. The togetherness ended."*

And the soloist responds:

> *"Yes — and let me tell you what that was like for ME."*

Every jazz musician who plays "Autumn Leaves" is telling **their own story of loss** using the same seven words. Cannonball Adderley's loss is not the same as Bill Evans' loss. Miles Davis' falling is not the same as Chet Baker's falling. But they are all falling through the same chords, the same circle of fifths, the same gravitational truth.

In Harmonia:

> **Jazz improvisation is the moment the language becomes truly alive — when someone uses the shared vocabulary to say something that has never been said before, and will never be said exactly this way again.**

This is what Harmonia was designed for. Not just translation, but **living speech.**

---

## Step 12: The Complete Poem

Assembling the full Harmonia translation:

---

**Autumn Leaves — Translated from Harmonia**

*Key: G minor — "The togetherness that is gone"*
*Meter: 4/4 swing — "Testimony, leaning toward the past"*
*Voice: A single instrument, accompanied by time (bass), memory (brushes), and the shared world (harmony)*

---

### The Head (First Chorus — The Text)

*(medium tempo, brushes whispering, leaning backward)*

> I was.
> I rose into the world once
> And the world opened like a question.
>
> Wanting was beautiful.
> Belonging was wondrous.
> We were home.
>
> And then what I knew
> Began to dissolve.
> The ground shifted.
>
> I was already falling.
> The togetherness was over.
> But something sweet remained
> In the shape of what was lost.

*(the turnaround — the year turns — back to the beginning)*

### The Second Chorus (Starting from Loss)

> What I understood is still dissolving.
> Where am I falling?
> The togetherness is still gone.
>
> But I WAS —
> The world once asked its shining question —
> And the wanting was so beautiful —
>
> Understanding crumbles again.
> The falling resumes.
> The togetherness... is still gone.
>
> I was.
> The world asked.
> I wanted.
> I belonged.
> I understood.
> I fell.
> We are no longer.
>
> Again.

### The Solo Section (The Personal Response)

*(here, the individual speaks — no two performances are the same)*

> [And now — tell me what you lost.
> Tell me what your autumn was.
> Use these seven words — Being, World, Desire, Home, Understanding, Movement, Connection —
> And say what only you can say.
> Fill the silence between the chords
> With your own falling.
> Lean back.
> Remember.
> Speak.]

### The Return to the Head (The Text, Repeated)

*(the composed melody returns — but colored by everything the soloist said)*

> I was.
> The world opened.
> Wanting was beautiful.
> Belonging was wondrous.
>
> Understanding dissolved.
> I fell.
> The togetherness ended.
>
> Something sweet remained.

### The Outro (Fading)

*(slower, softer, descending in register — moving from present into past)*

> I was... the world asked...
> Wanting... belonging...
> Understanding... falling...
> Together...
>
> ...was...
>
> ...

## Step 13: The Four-Piece Comparison

| | Für Elise | I'd Rather Go Blind | Hedwig's Theme | Autumn Leaves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Key** | A minor | A major | E minor | G minor |
| **Domain** | Knowledge absent | Knowledge present | Feeling absent | Connection absent |
| **Core truth** | "I feel but don't understand" | "I understand but can't stop feeling" | "Something is missing" | "We were, and are no longer" |
| **Shape** | Circle (oscillating) | Pendulum (two chords) | Ascending whisper | Descending spiral |
| **Harmonic vocabulary** | ~5 chords | 2 chords | ~5 chords | **7 extended chords** |
| **Why that number** | The mind circles through possibilities | There is nothing left to say | The spell needs few words | **Grief has many rooms, and you must pass through each** |
| **Speaker** | A man, to himself/her | A woman, to herself/him | Magic, to a child/us | **A soul, to time itself** |
| **Meter** | 3/8 — intimate turning | 4/4 — heavy truth | 3/4 — incantation | **4/4 swing — testimony leaning backward** |
| **Resolution** | None — the question remains | None — fades to silence | None — but promises fulfillment | **None — but the cycle continues, and there is sweetness in it** |
| **What repeats** | The theme (sameness) | The two chords (sameness) | The melody (growing) | **The entire descent (deepening each time)** |
| **Unique property** | — | — | — | **Improvisation — the listener becomes the speaker** |

---

## Step 14: The Insight That Emerges

Looking at all four pieces through Harmonia, a pattern reveals itself.

Each piece is about **the relationship between knowing and feeling**:

```
                    KNOWING
                      ↑
           Etta       |      Beethoven
         "I know,     |    "I feel,
      stop me from    |   help me
         feeling"     |   understand"
                      |
    FEELING ←————————————————→ NOT FEELING
                      |
       Autumn         |      Hedwig
       Leaves         |    "I feel the
     "I knew and      |   absence — fill
      felt, and       |   it with what
      both are        |    is missing"
       gone"          |
                      ↓
                  NOT KNOWING
```

- **Beethoven** (top right): Has feeling, lacks understanding
- **Etta** (top left): Has understanding, wants to lose it to keep feeling
- **Williams** (bottom right): Has the feeling of absence, awaits understanding of what's missing
- **Autumn Leaves** (bottom left): **Had both knowing and feeling. Lost both. And falls through the memory of each, one chord at a time, forever.**

Autumn Leaves occupies the most complete position — it has experienced **the full cycle**. It knew and felt and lost both. This is why it requires the most chords: it has the most to remember. And this is why it repeats: because **memory is a circle of fifths that only descends.**

---

## A Final Observation

There is one chord in "Autumn Leaves" that doesn't appear in any of the other three pieces we've translated:

**B♭maj7 — "How beautiful it was to want."**

Beethoven wants but doesn't know he wants. Etta wants but wishes she didn't. Williams wants without knowing what he wants.

Only "Autumn Leaves" has a chord that says:

> ***"I remember wanting. And the wanting itself was beautiful."***

This is what makes the song not merely sad but **deeply, irreducibly human.** It doesn't mourn the thing that was lost. It mourns the **longing** that was lost. It misses the missing. It aches for the ache.

In Harmonia, B♭maj7 is the most bittersweet word in the dictionary. It means: *the beauty of desire remembered from a place where desire has ended.*

No other chord says this. No other word in any spoken language says it quite this efficiently. It takes a major seventh chord built on the root of longing, heard in the context of a minor-key meditation on lost connection, falling through the circle of fifths toward an absence that will never be filled.

One chord. One word. An entire human truth.

That is what Harmonia was built to hear.
