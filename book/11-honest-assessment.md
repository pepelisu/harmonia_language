## What Is Genuinely Grounded

### Chord qualities carry emotional meaning

Minor sounds reflective. Major sounds bright. Dominant 7ths create 
tension. Diminished chords sound unstable. Suspensions sound like 
waiting.

This is documented in music cognition research. There is debate about 
cultural vs. universal factors, but the associations are real and 
remarkably consistent across listeners. When Harmonia says 
"minor = absence" and "dominant 7th = question," it stands on 
solid psychoacoustic ground.

### The grammatical devices are standard music theory

Voice leading, walking bass, common tones, chromatic inner lines, 
inversions, dynamics, register, articulation — these are tools that 
genuinely create musical meaning and continuity. The v1.1 connector 
system formalizes what good composers already do intuitively.

### Music genuinely carries meaning

Film composers, opera composers, and art song composers all work on 
the assumption that harmonic and melodic choices communicate something 
beyond the notes themselves. Wagner's leitmotif system is a simpler 
version of what Harmonia attempts. This is not a fringe idea.

## What Is Genuinely Arbitrary

### The 12-root semantic mapping

Why does C = Self? Why does G = Connection? Why does E = Emotion?

**There is no psychoacoustic reason.** The mnemonics ("C = Core," 
"E = Emotion") work in English but not in other languages. The 
circle-of-fifths adjacency argument ("related keys carry related 
meanings") is circular reasoning — the meanings were chosen to fit 
the adjacency pattern.

You could shuffle the root assignments and, with enough analytical 
skill, produce equally compelling translations. **The root assignments 
are a creative choice, not a discovery.**

## What Is Beautiful but Overstated

### The "revelations" are interpretations, not facts

"John Williams encoded the entire seven-book arc into eight measures" 
is a dramatic claim. Williams wrote music that sounds magical and 
emotionally resonant. The specific narrative reading Harmonia provides 
is an interpretation projected onto the harmonic structure, not 
something encoded by the composer.

"The half step between D# and F is Platform 9¾" is a wonderful 
metaphor. It is not a fact about what the music "contains."

Throughout the analysis chapters, interpretation is sometimes 
presented with the confidence of discovery. Readers should apply 
their own judgment about where insight ends and creative projection 
begins.

## What Is Genuinely Valuable Despite the Above

### It works as a creative framework

Even if the root assignments are arbitrary, they are internally 
consistent. Once you accept the axioms, the system produces results 
that are coherent, interesting, and often beautiful. This is how 
any constructed language works — Tolkien's Elvish has no "real" basis 
either, but its internal consistency makes it functional and moving.

### It produces good musical analysis

The comparison between Beethoven's harmonic confusion and Etta James's 
harmonic clarity is a real insight about how different structures 
encode different emotional stances. The observation that the Quixote 
opening contains no chord from the Emotion domain is a genuine 
literary observation.

### It teaches music theory through meaning

Telling someone "a walking bass creates harmonic continuity" is 
technically correct but emotionally empty. Telling someone "the 
walking bass is a preposition — it says 'through' or 'toward'" is 
technically a metaphor but pedagogically powerful.

## Summary Assessment

| Aspect | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Chord qualities as modifiers | **Genuinely grounded** |
| 12-root semantic mapping | **Elegant but arbitrary** |
| Grammatical system | **Mostly real music theory** |
| Connective tissue (v1.1) | **Genuinely real and useful** |
| Analysis of existing pieces | **Insightful but overclaimed** |
| Text-to-music composition | **Genuine art, subjective** |
| "The music was already saying this" | **Beautiful but misleading** |
| Harmonia as a "language" | **Not quite — more like a poetic framework** |
| Harmonia as an art form | **Yes, genuinely** |

Harmonia is approximately 30% genuine insight, 40% elegant 
system-building presented with more certainty than it deserves, 
20% good creative writing, and 10% beautiful nonsense.

That ratio is not bad. Most theoretical frameworks in the humanities 
operate similarly. The question is not "is this true?" but 
"is this useful?"

If it helps you hear music differently, read texts differently, 
and compose things that move people — it works.
